AY AY RON [SEP] added - i'm shooshi16
Masrim [SEP] Accepted
TRex1780 [SEP] I'm also good for a nightfall. TRex1780#1766 *edit: Just realized I'm a half hour late to this. Nvm, haha
Masrim [SEP] i can do another one
TRex1780 [SEP] I just hopped into wrapping up side missions I wanted to get rid of. Appreciate it, but maybe another time
Masrim [SEP] Np anytime
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone want to do a quick NF run?
MrGommyBoy [SEP] anyone for nightfall?
Masrim [SEP] anyone up for a nightfall?
Trissin [SEP] Is anybody interested in doing SOS either tonight or tomorrow?
Trissin [SEP] no experience is required or anything, just lmk if interested
TRex1780 [SEP] I'd be interested in tonight depending on timing. You can put me as a maybe, I guess?
TRex1780 [SEP] Aww yiss
Trissin [SEP] haha gotcha @TRex1780
Arixama [SEP] What's the power level recommended?
Trissin [SEP] I believe the recommended is 370
Trissin [SEP] btw, what time works well fo ryou @TRex1780 ?
Arixama [SEP] What time are you thinking?
TRex1780 [SEP] Oof. I didn't realize light level had to be 370, I only 348 right now. Maybe I should hold off for the time being
Trissin [SEP] ah ok I think that would be wise
Trissin [SEP] sorry @TRex1780 !
Trissin [SEP] also i'm good anytime after 5 @Arixama
TRex1780 [SEP] Nope, that's on me! Gotta get to grinding those weekly milestones
Trissin [SEP] yeah haha... that weekly grind
Arixama [SEP] Any idea about how long it would run?
Trissin [SEP] lmk if you need help with any of them @TRex1780 , and running normal leviathan + EOW are also fast ways to get your light up
Trissin [SEP] @Arixama it's hard to guess for now, I would say it depends on our group
Trissin [SEP] we should be able to get to the boss fight I think
Trissin [SEP] however the boss may take a while
Trissin [SEP] really just depends on communication and teamwork !
Arixama [SEP] I'm not sure exactly when I'll be home, but I'd definitely be down to try it.
Trissin [SEP] alright sweet, sounds good
Trissin [SEP] i'll let u know of any updates
Oathbreaker [SEP] I work tonight but I'm home around 9:30 EST. 368 PL so I might not be all that useful
Oathbreaker [SEP] That being said I am interested
Trissin [SEP] ooh sweet okay
Trissin [SEP] 368 isn't too bad, the ads will be a bit more dangerous but i think we should give it a shot
Arixama [SEP] I'll probably be on around 530 cst or so
Trissin [SEP] i think thats 6:30 est
Masrim [SEP] I can do any time tonight.  My wife aggro is at an all time low
Trissin [SEP] lool awesome!
Trissin [SEP] haha
Masrim [SEP] Anytime want to do a quick nf
RonInDune [SEP] Yo @Masrim I'm down. I'm level 354 though, is that ok?
Masrim [SEP] I just hooked up with arixama and CNC. But I need to get 2 done so if you are around after
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah
Arixama [SEP] anybody want to run the arms dealer acrius quest with @TheCnC and me?
Masrim [SEP] Ron and I are looking for 1 more to do nf
RonInDune [SEP] Yup
Masrim [SEP] Let's try this haha
Trissin [SEP] do u guys need anohter?
Trissin [SEP] i can join for nf
RonInDune [SEP] yeah!
Masrim [SEP] Sure
Trissin [SEP] alright give me a sec
Masrim [SEP] Was just going to pick up a random otherwise
Masrim [SEP] Trissin is u I guess
Trissin [SEP] yep haha
RonInDune [SEP] That was great!
Trissin [SEP] yeah!
Trissin [SEP] good run
Masrim [SEP] Woohoo
Masrim [SEP] Ok my NF are all done. Anyone need a body for anything
RonInDune [SEP] @Masrim should I invite you in?
Trissin [SEP] @PC so who's running spire tonight?
Masrim [SEP] Sure. And I can but have never done that so understand if that is no good
Trissin [SEP] nono its all good!
Trissin [SEP] i dont mind teaching it
Trissin [SEP] we can help ron with his quest first tho
Arixama [SEP] im max 375 id be up for it
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah hope it's short!
TheCnC [SEP] I'm max 366,  a little low but I would do my absolute best
Trissin [SEP] I think we can try it out!
Trissin [SEP] ads will be kinda tough
Trissin [SEP] but we should definitely give it a try'
Oathbreaker [SEP] Max 368. If I get a few drops I might be able to bring it up to 370
Oathbreaker [SEP] That being said I'm interested
Trissin [SEP] sweet!
Trissin [SEP] so we're 5 then, is that correct?
Arixama [SEP] sounds like it
Oathbreaker [SEP] Logging in now
Trissin [SEP] looks like we need one more for spire @PC
MrGommyBoy [SEP] 380 is required right?
Trissin [SEP] recommended is 370
Trissin [SEP] i think 365+ should be ok'
MrGommyBoy [SEP] Oh okay
Trissin [SEP] ads might be a bit tough
Trissin [SEP] but it should be alright
MrGommyBoy [SEP] I'm 378
Trissin [SEP] oh yeah thats fine
MrGommyBoy [SEP] And ive never run it before though
Trissin [SEP] no worries!
Trissin [SEP] no exp required at all
MrGommyBoy [SEP] ok cool I'll com,e then
MrGommyBoy [SEP] we using voice chat?
Trissin [SEP] yes, we will be starting soon
Trissin [SEP] sorry im just in a strike rn
Arixama [SEP] thats chill.
MrGommyBoy [SEP] all good
RonInDune [SEP] That was so good. I'm starting to like this game! /s
MrGommyBoy [SEP] ive got the full levi set with all the mods lol
Trissin [SEP] ayyy, nice!!
Trissin [SEP] alright I am in the voice channel
Trissin [SEP] go ahead and join up on trissin!
Arixama [SEP] will be in in a few
Trissin [SEP] Was thinking about the run last night, we should try the arcstrider strat since we already have so many hunters
Trissin [SEP] Everybody just needs a Raiden Flux, and during dmg phase we just slam his feet
Arixama [SEP] i could also pop in as my hunter
Trissin [SEP] haha that would make 6 arcstriders!
Trissin [SEP] I think it's worth a shot
Masrim [SEP] That could work. Maybe 1 Titan with melting point
Oathbreaker [SEP] Definitely could. Gonna do a run of EoW today and maybe regular Leviathan just to get the Power Level increases and not be a potato when it comes to the enemies
Masrim [SEP] Lol I never did a raid before so I thought last night was the regular one
Oathbreaker [SEP] Really? You did well then last night. Spire of Stars is the second raid lair that was released for D2. Leviathan is the base raid, Eater of Worlds is the other raid lair.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Eater of Worlds is my preferred raid just because it's a good balance between length and challenge. I find it to be the most fun.
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Trissin did you guys finish Spire? first time we cleared we did 5 arcstriders + 1 melting point. second and third time we had 3 arcstriders + 3 coils w/ Luna rifts. proved to be very clean two phases.
Oathbreaker [SEP] We didn't finish Spire. I had to go last night, was past 1 AM my time lol. We're gonna give it another go sometime soon
thegoaliebear [SEP] oh okay aha. well for your first clear I would definitely recommend 5 or all arcstriders.
thegoaliebear [SEP] were you guys sending one person up to destroy the ships or were you sending two? we only send one and it makes things massively easier.
Oathbreaker [SEP] We would send 2. It was working out fine imo, just we had trouble killing the gladiators and that was what wasted the most time for us
Masrim [SEP] Yeah we might need to equip some rocket launchers
thegoaliebear [SEP] if your arcstriders have shotguns (EP shotty or Zenith are best) those will take them down very quick. or jump back and use a coil shot. one coil and then some primary shots take care of them nicely.
thegoaliebear [SEP] only rocket launcher you would need is coil😜
Masrim [SEP] Wardcliff?
Masrim [SEP] I got that at 378 or 379 so I'm good to go haha
Oathbreaker [SEP] I just need a better helmet. Hoping I can snag one from Leviathan or EoW
Masrim [SEP] I need to learn to jump better lol
thegoaliebear [SEP] yeah wardcliff is all you need for the boss aha. does crazy damage and will take the gladiators down very quick.
MrGommyBoy [SEP] We doing SoS again today?
Trissin [SEP] I'd like to, depends on everybody else
MrGommyBoy [SEP] okay lol i can go for a bit
Arixama [SEP] I won't be on until around 530
Trissin [SEP] no worries
MrGommyBoy [SEP] you wanna come to one i joined?
Masrim [SEP] You need anything body?
Masrim [SEP] Another not anything lol
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'd like to do it again. Hit 371 so I'm not a potato anymore with gear.
TRex1780 [SEP] Any chance anyone would be interested in a leviathan or EoW run tomorrow morning? Still a bit new with both, but wanting to get them down better.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone want to do some Valor grinding (QP/Mayhem) for MoT?
RonInDune [SEP] How hard is the rat kings crew quest? Has everyone here completed it?
Arixama [SEP] pretty easy, you just need people to do it with
Arixama [SEP] the toughest part is doing the nightfall
RonInDune [SEP] Hmm, if anyone has  the time, it'd be cool to finish it
Trissin [SEP] oh actually I still need to finish that as well
Masrim [SEP] I haven't yet. Would be willing to grind it with you
Trissin [SEP] i believe you can only do it with people who either have the rat king, or they are on the same step of the quest
RonInDune [SEP] Ohh, so first some patrols
RonInDune [SEP] for me
RonInDune [SEP] then public events then crucible then nightfall
Trissin [SEP] seems like it
Trissin [SEP] i dont actually remember tho
RonInDune [SEP] I cheated and googled it
Trissin [SEP] lol
RonInDune [SEP] I was going around the edz and trying to shoot rats
Masrim [SEP] I'm at the part where you have to do strikes with clan mates
RonInDune [SEP] that's apparently the last step
Arixama [SEP] if you guys need somebody to help you all get on the same step i can hop in quick
RonInDune [SEP] do we have to be on the same level? not sure
RonInDune [SEP] oh yeah that'd be awesome
Masrim [SEP] Then get to work haha
RonInDune [SEP] i'm online
RonInDune [SEP] that was awkward
Arixama [SEP] @Trissin did you need to get to a certain step?
Trissin [SEP] nono im good thanks!
RonInDune [SEP] one more public event for me
Masrim [SEP] Sorry. I'm out walking the dog right now lol.  Will be on later
Trissin [SEP] so my friends and I are running through EOW, one person is new and has never done it before
Trissin [SEP] we need one more
Trissin [SEP] _(warning: really cancerous group)_
Trissin [SEP] _(**really** cancerous)_
Trissin [SEP] @PC
Masrim [SEP] Cancerous?
Trissin [SEP] yes
Masrim [SEP] How so lol
Trissin [SEP] i dont know how to explain it
Trissin [SEP] with words
TheCnC [SEP] Like...will I get cancer if I join this group?
Trissin [SEP] probably
Trissin [SEP] it's loud and very chaotic
Trissin [SEP] haha
Masrim [SEP] Are they going to shit on you if you make a mistake haha
Trissin [SEP] jokingly
TheCnC [SEP] Like normal asshole cancerous or elitist we know everything you're terribad GTFO cancerous?
TheCnC [SEP] ^
Trissin [SEP] nah they're not really assholes they just fuck around a lot
Trissin [SEP] eow should be quick but it will probably take a bit longer
Trissin [SEP] because of
Trissin [SEP] chaos
Trissin [SEP] lol
Trissin [SEP] also the conversation goes to some
Trissin [SEP] very interesting places
Trissin [SEP] they're not assholes but they do fool around
Trissin [SEP] anybody interested? lol
Trissin [SEP] @PC
Masrim [SEP] I want to but I need to wait a little to play.  Just got back from walk and wife is looking at me the way vandals who are just out of range of you watch you
Trissin [SEP] lmaooo
Trissin [SEP] how long?
Masrim [SEP] Like 30 minutes at least
Masrim [SEP] She should go to bed by then haha
RonInDune [SEP] The third step in rats king is the crucible right?
Trissin [SEP] ah... we were planning on starting a bit earlier @Masrim
Trissin [SEP] sorry!!!!
Masrim [SEP] No worries. I was going to do some rat King of red is still on when I am
Trissin [SEP] Is anybody good at trials?
Trissin [SEP] I am terrible
Trissin [SEP] but i wanna get better
RonInDune [SEP] I just got access to them, so you can guess...
Arixama [SEP] i havent played since release
RonInDune [SEP] Oh @Arixama I figured out why I couldnt complete rat kings
RonInDune [SEP] Apparantly we either have to be on the same quest step or one of us has to equip the rat kings weapon
Masrim [SEP] which step are you on now
RonInDune [SEP] The crucible one
RonInDune [SEP] #3
Arixama [SEP] thats kind of what i figured after the second match not giving it to you
Oathbreaker [SEP] Mayhem Valor grinding anyone?
RonInDune [SEP] Yo anyone up for some heroic mars missions? I having a heck of a time completing the nascent dawn 2 quest. Keep dying at the very last stage.
Masrim [SEP] lets go knock it out, let me log on
RonInDune [SEP] yay!
Masrim [SEP] estimated wait time to log in (after they kicked me out) is 76 minutes?!?!?
Trissin [SEP] ???
Masrim [SEP] blizzard says its a busy day
Masrim [SEP] sunday at 11:30pm est, real busy time  lol
RonInDune [SEP] I think it's the free weekend
Trissin [SEP] ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Masrim [SEP] how does that affect it?
RonInDune [SEP] Trillions of people logging in
Masrim [SEP] down to 9 minutes now, was a quick 76 minutes lol
Masrim [SEP] but why did they kick me out
RonInDune [SEP] I think when you moved zones they couldn't find an empty server to slot you in
RonInDune [SEP] See:
https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/06/how-destiny-2-works/
Masrim [SEP] it said I had to restart and update blizzard, I was going to a lost secor
Masrim [SEP] so there is only ever 8 other people playing with you?
RonInDune [SEP] Yup, plus your fireteam
Masrim [SEP] never noticed that before
RonInDune [SEP] ALso that's why during the escalation events in Mars, all other enemies in the maps almost disappear
Masrim [SEP] that is a pretty good read
Masrim [SEP] explains why wacking shit happens in strikes sometimes
RonInDune [SEP] Rockpapershotgun's The MEchanic series of articles is fascinating
RonInDune [SEP] Yup yup
Masrim [SEP] Back to grinding this Lance
RonInDune [SEP] Good luck
Masrim [SEP] No luck needed. Just boredom and thralls
Masrim [SEP] Lol
Arixama [SEP] anybody want to help me run through the acrius arms dealer strike?
Masrim [SEP] Sure. Give me 2 minutes
RonInDune [SEP] I'm light level 357, is that too low?
Arixama [SEP] recommended is 300
RonInDune [SEP] Oh I'm on my way then
RonInDune [SEP] I'm ready when you want
Arixama [SEP] basically a nightfall with solar singe and equipment locked
Masrim [SEP] got booted again saying I have to restart destiny
Masrim [SEP] OK, finally got all 3 levels on each character, taking a break until tomorrow unless someone wants to do leviathon or something (never done it yet)
Trissin [SEP] nice!! I wouldn't mind running/teaching leviathan whenever people would like
TRex1780 [SEP] I'm at 349 light and need to raid more often to get through this grind, so I'd be interested in leviathan or EoW as long as life schedule lines up
Trissin [SEP] yeah! I'd love to help, just lmk when!
Arixama [SEP] I'd be down to run leviathan again. I gotta get them acrius seals.
TRex1780 [SEP] I'm generally around this whole week from 5 PM EST on except for Tuesday, not sure what everyone else's availability is like
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah I'm down for leviathan as a noobie
RonInDune [SEP] Evenings are best
Trissin [SEP] looks like we got 5 already, sweet
Trissin [SEP] does later tonight work (~9:30ish EST) @Masrim @TRex1780 @Arixama @RonInDune
RonInDune [SEP] I started the raid once alone died 10 times before realizing I'm an idiot. It should go a lot better this time round.
Trissin [SEP] lol!
Trissin [SEP] yeah haha
RonInDune [SEP] That is perfect for me.
Trissin [SEP] let's see if we can get 1 more too
Arixama [SEP] That works for me. I generally don't work Monday to Wednesday so I can be up til whenever
TRex1780 [SEP] I actually probably can't start that late, work trainings this week means I'm trying to get to bed a little earlier than the usual. I'll get on other runs though, don't wait for me if you can get 6
Trissin [SEP] noo trex! what if we started a bit earlier then?
Trissin [SEP] we could try starting between 5-7, whenever works for most people
Trissin [SEP] I cant make that today but if you guys get 6 you should go for it!
RonInDune [SEP] I'll be off work roughly 2 1/2 hours from now, so anytime after that
TRex1780 [SEP] I'd say 730 is probably as late as I can start, maybe 8 if I want to hate myself the next day
RonInDune [SEP] I'm available at 7:30 EST
Masrim [SEP] 730 works for me
Masrim [SEP] i have a question, for that last raid we went on, how are people supposed to figure all that crap out?
TRex1780 [SEP] So we definitely have me, @RonInDune , and @Masrim. Anyone else available 730 EST?  (10 mins from now) I have a firend outside the clan who might be able to fill a spot if needed
RonInDune [SEP] How bout @Trissin ?
Masrim [SEP] If lizard cannot make it do we have anyone that knows what to do?
Masrim [SEP] He said he cannot make it until 9ish I think
RonInDune [SEP] Oh dang
TRex1780 [SEP] I've run a few times, I can talk us through gauntlet, baths, and calus. Dogs could be troublesome, and I don't know the underbelly well enough to use it
RonInDune [SEP] How good is the official destiny website LFG?
TRex1780 [SEP] Never tried it, honestly
Arixama [SEP] I've run leviathan a few times as well
Arixama [SEP] Dogs is always troublesome if you don't have someone who knows where to go well
TRex1780 [SEP] That's exactly it for me, I don't know the dogs paths or their damage phase locations that great
TRex1780 [SEP] I don't know about everyone else, but if availability works better, we could always try this later in the week
RonInDune [SEP] That's cool with me, I'm free all nights
RonInDune [SEP] How hard is Trials of the Nine?
Arixama [SEP] Basically depends on who you get matched against, but generally pretty hard
RonInDune [SEP] Ah well
TRex1780 [SEP] So I think we're in agreement on holding on the raid. If that's the case, now I have no excuse to not go on my run for the day 😑
RonInDune [SEP] Good luck running! I swam for an hour and am beat
TRex1780 [SEP] Shoot, that's a ton of swimming! Haha, thanks bud
Masrim [SEP] anyone doing anything?  im bored grinding catalysts
TheCnC [SEP] Most any other evening I would be down for leviathan
NickyDynamite [SEP] Hey guys, im trying to run a friend through the raid with a couple of other friends. Anyone wanna do it? We need 2 more.
NickyDynamite [SEP] Just leviathan normal
Masrim [SEP] sure
Arixama [SEP] You got a time frame?
Arixama [SEP] I could hop on but I just ordered a pizza
NickyDynamite [SEP] Uh we're goin as soon as possible so if you wanna join and just take a break when your pizza comes, that's cool
Arixama [SEP] sounds good to me
NickyDynamite [SEP] I think you can join on me.  We're in another discord, I can invite you
Trissin [SEP] oh noooo im so sorry guys, yeah I was busy earlier tonight
Arixama [SEP] dynamite in game?
NickyDynamite [SEP] Yep
NickyDynamite [SEP] I should change my nickname
Trissin [SEP] are we good to start at 7:30 EST tomorrow? (and also I think we are looking for one more!)
@Arixama @Masrim @TRex1780 @RonInDune
RonInDune [SEP] Yup Yup
Arixama [SEP] @TheCnC said that he'd probably be good to do one
Trissin [SEP] sweet sweet
RonInDune [SEP] I can''t waot
RonInDune [SEP] *wait
Sabre [SEP] @Trissin and whoever else, if you guys need one more ill probably be on and would be down to do the raid
Trissin [SEP] anybody free to quickly help me out with prestige nightfall
Trissin [SEP] haven't found a way to solo the boss....at least not on warlock
Trissin [SEP] (im on the boss)
RonInDune [SEP] I'm a warlock at lvl 357, I can join in
Trissin [SEP] tyty
RonInDune [SEP] coming hang on
Trissin [SEP] much appreciated
Trissin [SEP] take your time
Trissin [SEP] btw the modifier is void singe
RonInDune [SEP] Aww crap
Trissin [SEP] haha we got it, ty ron!
RonInDune [SEP] That was quite fun actually
RonInDune [SEP] Hard as balls though
TheCnC [SEP] @Trissin I'm good for tonight at 730
Trissin [SEP] awesome, just gotta see if @Arixama @TRex1780 and @Masrim are good with that time
TRex1780 [SEP] I should be as well
Trissin [SEP] great!
Arixama [SEP] Definitely good
Masrim [SEP] I WILL give it one more go  haha
Trissin [SEP] what
Masrim [SEP] wife aggro is getting high though,  essentially I got spotted by a dog and the hounds are about to start howling
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Masrim [SEP] haha, just because I have been on here late 3 nights in a row, until 1 or 2am
Masrim [SEP] is perfect paradox a good shotgun?
Trissin [SEP] **yes**
Trissin [SEP] in my personal opinion, i'd put it in the top 3
Trissin [SEP] behind only the EP shotgun and tractor cannon
Masrim [SEP] but tractor is not good for leviathon right?\
Trissin [SEP] _well_
Trissin [SEP] that's a bit of a loaded question
Trissin [SEP] i would say it depends on strategy
Trissin [SEP] some of the more off-meta strategies use tractor cannon a lot
Masrim [SEP] if you are doing void everywhere it is good
Trissin [SEP] yeah exactly
Trissin [SEP] one strat a lot of people dont know is that the tractor cannon actually works on lanterns in the baths
Masrim [SEP] That would speed things up tremendously
Trissin [SEP] yeah, a voidwalker running top tree can tractor cannon a full set of 3 lanterns and nova bomb it
Trissin [SEP] immediately destroying a full set
Trissin [SEP] faster than sunbreaker too
Trissin [SEP] also, voidwalker running scatter grenade can literally _delete_ a dog in the gardens
Trissin [SEP] tractor cannon, and then scatter grenade its feet
Masrim [SEP] That is good to know
Trissin [SEP] yeah, i got this all from a video by indica
Trissin [SEP] let me link it
Trissin [SEP] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz6stgQ2QmU
Masrim [SEP] Cool I should watch those today.  I start a new job next week so won't have as much time haha
Trissin [SEP] ahh gotcha
Masrim [SEP] raids might have to be a weekend only thing for me
Masrim [SEP] in the future
Masrim [SEP] Might have to try to get some EP parties going to get that shotgun
Masrim [SEP] Is the basilisk any good?
TheCnC [SEP] @Trissin Turns out I may be a little late to raid time, I may have to pick up someone at 7 and quick drop them off.  Latest I should be would 15-20 minutes late.
Masrim [SEP] That's it. You have to bring pizza for everyone
RonInDune [SEP] 🍕
TheCnC [SEP] I'll email it to you
RonInDune [SEP] Man I haven't had pizza in so long. It's been almost 12 hours.
Masrim [SEP] i just got a 50% off coupon from dominoes  yay!  bad thing is there is not one in delivery range to me  😦
Masrim [SEP] Who wants to try a prestige nf with heavy and arc singe
Bobthedog [SEP] Are there any plans to do prestige raid lairs next week?
RonInDune [SEP] What kind of light levels do they need?
Sabre [SEP] I don't think they've announced that unless I just missed it
Arixama [SEP] Most likely 385 since SOS is 370
TheCnC [SEP] Would sweet business or wardcliff be better for leviathan tonight?
TheCnC [SEP] my gut says the biz would be better for inside to rack up the skull count
Masrim [SEP] not sure myself, never made it to the skull section.
Masrim [SEP] anyone on here use windows 7?
RonInDune [SEP] I have a bunch of Win 7 VMs running
Masrim [SEP] through 10?
TRex1780 [SEP] I think sweet business is good for skulls, but wardcliff has a lot of uses in any damage phase throughout the raid
TheCnC [SEP] that's what I thought.  empowering rift with sweet biz at the end seems like a guaranteed 1 phase lol
TRex1780 [SEP] Could be! I might be misremembering, but I think if you had prometheus lens, every skull pop counted as a kill, so it put more ammo in the clip, and that was ludicrously good. Definitely doesn't work that way now though
TheCnC [SEP] I used coldheart last time I did this raid with the rift and it wrecked skulls pretty well so I can only assume biz will be that much better
Masrim [SEP] Crimson should do well
Trissin [SEP] sorry I'm a bit late! just give me a few minutes
Arixama [SEP] no problem
TheCnC [SEP] I was even on time!
TRex1780 [SEP] No worries!
TheCnC [SEP] Pizza isn't on me tonight!
Masrim [SEP] We've been waiting for hours
Masrim [SEP] For voidlock should I go top or bottom
Trissin [SEP] may want to switch it up during the raid
Trissin [SEP] we'll see
Trissin [SEP] is @RonInDune here?
RonInDune [SEP] Yessir
Trissin [SEP] okay great!
RonInDune [SEP] Dunno if my loadout is potimal
Trissin [SEP] ah it's fine
Trissin [SEP] go ahead and join up on me in orbit @Arixama @RonInDune @Masrim @TRex1780 @TheCnC
Trissin [SEP] oh wait
Trissin [SEP] im gettign error code weasel
Arixama [SEP] every body want to join on me then?
TheCnC [SEP] raid alpha right?
RonInDune [SEP] Uh I got disconnected
RonInDune [SEP] What the heck happened
RonInDune [SEP] I got booted to desktop
Trissin [SEP] uh oh
RonInDune [SEP] I'm coming back
Trissin [SEP] no worries
Trissin [SEP] @RonInDune can u join the voice chat in discord?
RonInDune [SEP] Uh hang on
RonInDune [SEP] Thanks for a great raid guys. It was freaking awesome.
Trissin [SEP] ofc! glad you enjoyed it, I had a great time as well
Trissin [SEP] if anybody is interested in doing levi, eow, sos, or even prestige levi can just lmk and I would love to join in!
Trissin [SEP] dont mind teaching it either
Oathbreaker [SEP] Wish I could have joined in! Sadly had work. Glad to hear that you guys had a good time
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm always down for a good raid
Sabre [SEP] @Oathbreaker if you wanna do one some time this week, lmk id be down
Trissin [SEP] oh hey @Sabre ! sorry we didn't have space for you tonight!!!
Trissin [SEP] 😦
Sabre [SEP] all good! haha another time
Masrim [SEP] thanks again lizard for guiding.. and all others who helped teach, I think I'm an expert now  😉
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'll be looking to do some tomorrow for sure. Maybe Friday night after 1pm est once I get off work, and again for sure on Sunday night (5pm est) and monday at any time
Trissin [SEP] yeah! glad our clan is finally becoming a bit more active haha
RonInDune [SEP] You guys are indeed pretty nice
Arixama [SEP] yeah me too. it wasnt super active even just a couple weeks ago.
Trissin [SEP] I am actually going out of town for a while starting tomorrow, and I wont be back for a while unfortunately
Oathbreaker [SEP] Always glad to have a group of people to run things with. Maybe we can get some EP going sometime soon!
Trissin [SEP] but in that time I think you guys should give eow a shot
Trissin [SEP] yeah!! ep for sure
RonInDune [SEP] Try guiding us via smoke signals
Trissin [SEP] LOL
Trissin [SEP] hahaha
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm familiar with EoW so yeah, you know what, I could try leading that maybe
Trissin [SEP] that sounds awesome!
Masrim [SEP] definitely ep, I want that shotty!!!
RonInDune [SEP] THat'd be great! I just started a second character, so all this extra gear will help.
Arixama [SEP] ive run eow once
Masrim [SEP] having 3 chars really speeds up the LL grind
Oathbreaker [SEP] Last time I led a raid it was D1 lol. Sherpa'd a group going through Wrath of the Machine
Masrim [SEP] they have to be different classes though
Trissin [SEP] oh FUN @Oathbreaker
Trissin [SEP] i loved wrath
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I just started the hunter, already got one 361 warlock
Oathbreaker [SEP] Vault of Glass was easily my favorite to sherpa
Trissin [SEP] _areyoukidding_ vog was the worstt
Oathbreaker [SEP] NOOOOO
Oathbreaker [SEP] KINGS FALL
Oathbreaker [SEP] BY MILES
Trissin [SEP] nah
Trissin [SEP] crotas end was actually the worst
Oathbreaker [SEP] SO MANY LITTLE TECHNICAL ERRORS WOULD KILL A RUN
Trissin [SEP] but just
Trissin [SEP] atheon
Trissin [SEP] my first fclear of atheon took
Trissin [SEP] centuries
Oathbreaker [SEP] I count the Y1 version of Crota as a strike so...
Trissin [SEP] LOL
Oathbreaker [SEP] Atheon was a coordination check in the best of ways
Oathbreaker [SEP] It wasn't a hard check
Oathbreaker [SEP] Y1 level 26s could clear it with enough patience
Oathbreaker [SEP] Get up to like 28 with the old system and that's when it got easy
Oathbreaker [SEP] Templar was fun and was challenging to a degree
Oathbreaker [SEP] King's Fall was fun for sure, but trying to sherpa it was beyond brutal. It forced perfection in the later fights. Warpriest you could make errors and still win. Golgoroth you could make errors but still get the DPS to beat him. Deathsingers was where you hoped you didn't have a Warlock get runner and if you did you wiped. It was also really hard to have to try and coordinate. And then Oryx, good lord Oryx. 20 minutes of mechanic based actions where you only do damage to the boss himself is right at the end. You just had to hope your team could hold it together until the end or you waste a whole bunch of time
Trissin [SEP] oh my god thats a large paragraph
Trissin [SEP] hahahah
Oathbreaker [SEP] I have my dislikes about King's Fall lmfao
Oathbreaker [SEP] Wrath took the best parts of all the raids and molded them together IMO
Trissin [SEP] actually I believe someone in here _loved_  running as a warlock in KF
Oathbreaker [SEP] I mean some Warlock mains did really well
Oathbreaker [SEP] Just in my experience with PUGs the Warlocks tended to be alt characters
Trissin [SEP] ah haha
Trissin [SEP] you know
Trissin [SEP] this clan was almost gonna be called shoot the shooties right @thegoaliebear
Oathbreaker [SEP] Oh boy do I ever.
Trissin [SEP] i still think it should be shoot the shooties
Trissin [SEP] but yknow
Trissin [SEP] thats me
Arixama [SEP] ive only ever run vog and crota
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Trissin we do not speak of that.
Trissin [SEP] LOL
Oathbreaker [SEP] Ari, you on Xbox?
Oathbreaker [SEP] For D1?
Arixama [SEP] no ps4
Oathbreaker [SEP] Damn. Was gonna offer a few runs of the other raids
Trissin [SEP] i'd love to get back into destiny 1 and run through KF and wrath, absolutely
Trissin [SEP] i was on ps4 as well
Arixama [SEP] i;ve got it insatalled
Trissin [SEP] not that excited about vog or crota haha
Arixama [SEP] got a lock and a titan at 400
Oathbreaker [SEP] Vog I just had way too many good memories of
Trissin [SEP] ooooh nice
Trissin [SEP] ew i have so many bad memories of vog
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] and a level 9 hunter!
Oathbreaker [SEP] Sure it's got its faults that other raids improve upon
Oathbreaker [SEP] But I found that it was the one I just kept coming back to
Trissin [SEP] i thought crotas end was just.. idk
Trissin [SEP] too simple?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Time and time again
Oathbreaker [SEP] Again
Oathbreaker [SEP] it was a strike in Y1
Trissin [SEP] hahaha
Oathbreaker [SEP] I solo'd that shit once
Trissin [SEP] lmaooooo
Oathbreaker [SEP] If you can solo a raid
Oathbreaker [SEP] You're doing something wrong
Trissin [SEP] @ solo aksis
Oathbreaker [SEP] Unless you're Gladd or Slayerage
Trissin [SEP] lolol was about to say
Oathbreaker [SEP] Okay actually Solo Aksis is really demanding
Trissin [SEP] yeah
Oathbreaker [SEP] I still want to try it actually
Trissin [SEP] im not sure i want to try that
Oathbreaker [SEP] I don't even know if it's possible anymore
Oathbreaker [SEP] Key strategies might have been nerfed
Trissin [SEP] 🤔
Trissin [SEP] who knows
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'll look into it lol. If I'm feeling particularly insane one night I'll see what I need to do
Trissin [SEP] hahahha
Trissin [SEP] also didnt gladd solo oryx?
Trissin [SEP] i havent even seen that one yet
Trissin [SEP] still have no idea
Oathbreaker [SEP] Solo Oryx is no longer possibel
Oathbreaker [SEP] Possible*
Trissin [SEP] oh what???
Oathbreaker [SEP] Used the Sleeper before it's nerf at the start of ROI
Trissin [SEP] well now im really curious
Oathbreaker [SEP] It was a pseudo-nerf, purely because they changed its interaction with Oryx's chest
Oathbreaker [SEP] So unless you were a GG with Nighthawk somehow getting enough super energy to get 4 supers off the solo isn't possible iirc
Trissin [SEP] ahhh
Oathbreaker [SEP] I HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRON
Oathbreaker [SEP] WRONG*
Oathbreaker [SEP] Esoterickk did it with Touch of Malice after the SS change
Trissin [SEP] yeah im watching gladd rn, he's using touch as well
Trissin [SEP] and its definitely after roi because he also does aksis later in the video
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah that was the one he does all possible ones back to back to back right?
Trissin [SEP] yep!!
Oathbreaker [SEP] That was beyond insane
Trissin [SEP] gladd isn't human
Oathbreaker [SEP] No
Oathbreaker [SEP] Not at all
Oathbreaker [SEP] And he's about to 2 man EOW wtf
Trissin [SEP] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Trissin [SEP] just gladd things
Masrim [SEP] makes you wonder what 3rd party assists he is using
Masrim [SEP] if anyones up for a NF hit me up, can even do prestige (likely with heavy and arc singe)
Trissin [SEP] im down for a nf
Masrim [SEP] Let's make it happen.  I'm just going Flash point atm
Trissin [SEP] kk, logging on now
Trissin [SEP] if anybody else wants in they're free to join
Arixama [SEP] on my way in
Arixama [SEP] might be slightly garbage
Trissin [SEP] go ahead and join up on us
Trissin [SEP] just doing normal for now
Masrim [SEP] I love heavy day
Masrim [SEP] Killed Zahn before we got half way up the elevator
Masrim [SEP] I wish there were tabs in the vault
Arixama [SEP] I wish there was any sort of logical organization in the vault.
Masrim [SEP] True
Arixama [SEP] I put all my legendary mods and shaders in there and there will be like a line of mods and then some weapons and then more mods
Masrim [SEP] But you can sort by newest
Arixama [SEP] Oh I've looked at all the sorting types and they don't seem to make sense for the mods as far as I can tell
Masrim [SEP] They don't. All useless
xspartinx [SEP] going do some normal rifts for powerful engrams if anyone wants to help me
xspartinx [SEP] strikes
xspartinx [SEP] lol
Masrim [SEP] How do you get powerful from normal strikes?
xspartinx [SEP] mildstone
Masrim [SEP] Ahh the heroics. They are easy today. Solar and heavy
xspartinx [SEP] no normals
xspartinx [SEP] i got to do 2 normals
Masrim [SEP] For a powerful Engram?
xspartinx [SEP] wait it not powerful just a leg
xspartinx [SEP] my b
Masrim [SEP] Heroics should count
Masrim [SEP] For those don't they?
xspartinx [SEP] we can try it yea want to
xspartinx [SEP] it says mildstone under normal strikes
Masrim [SEP] I'm not at home yet. Walking the dog
Masrim [SEP] Usually that is the minimum
Masrim [SEP] I think
xspartinx [SEP] no idea
Masrim [SEP] But you need to do 3 heroics any way
xspartinx [SEP] yea
xspartinx [SEP] i just swaped from ps4 to pc on sunday
Arixama [SEP] so it's probably the nightfall unlock milestone
Masrim [SEP] Sounds like it
xspartinx [SEP] yes it is
xspartinx [SEP] every time i try to get randoms it puts me in there solo
Masrim [SEP] That's people abondoning because they don't like the strike
xspartinx [SEP] and why are my wait time so dang long on everything takes like 10 mins to just get in a crucible match
Oathbreaker [SEP] I've got a guy who's looking to join the clan. Am I good to just send him the links and stuff and he joins up or does someone specific need to do that?
RonInDune [SEP] Did you tell him about the secret blood ritual already?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Not just yet, don't want to scare him away just yet
TheCnC [SEP] anyone still need to do the nightfall?
RonInDune [SEP] I do!
TheCnC [SEP] Awesome.  Just getting logged in now
RonInDune [SEP] Me too, hang on
Masrim [SEP] I do. But won't be on until tomorrow evening. Golf day tomorrow
RonInDune [SEP] Thanks for a great one, you guys rule
xspartinx [SEP] iron banner anyone?
Masrim [SEP] Anyone know the Nessus hvt that spawns with a Minotaur guard
Masrim [SEP] And the cabal inside a cage
Masrim [SEP] Well it spawned on top of me and I'm stuck in the cage with that thing lol
Sabre [SEP] lmfaoo thats amazing
RonInDune [SEP] Damn @Masrim  that's a one in a million event. You should buy a lottery ticket today.
Masrim [SEP] You could do it on purpose by just waiting there likely
RonInDune [SEP] I tried that once, didn't happen, I got pushed to the right
Masrim [SEP] I took a screen shot and a pic with my phone haha
RonInDune [SEP] Post it on reddit or something. Or ask Bungie for a refund, broken game.
Masrim [SEP] I got the game free with my video card lol. Spent 25 on the expansions though
Masrim [SEP] I should have took a pic when it was alive. But that guy hits hard
Masrim [SEP] Honestly surprised I survived
TRex1780 [SEP] Any chance folks might be available for a lev or EoW run tomorrow afternoon? Got a buddy who's never run a raid before, want to take him through one or the other
Sabre [SEP] yeah ive done lev a few times, id be down
Masrim [SEP] I can do one
Sabre [SEP] Anyone feel like playing Trials? I havent done it yet
Masrim [SEP] What's trials?
Sabre [SEP] trials of the nine, its the weekend PvP playlist. if you win matches in a set, you get rewards but if you lose 3 your win count resets
Masrim [SEP] Ahh
Arixama [SEP] @TRex1780 what time are you thinking?
TRex1780 [SEP] Didn't have any solid time in particular. As long as it's afternoon EST, my friend and I should be alright
Arixama [SEP] coolio, i should be in
Sabre [SEP] So @Arixama, @TRex1780, @Masrim, Trex's Friend, and me. Just need one more
Aberration [SEP] Hey all - its a bit last minute but I have a couple hours before I have to travel, anyone looking to do any EP?
TRex1780 [SEP] For the raid group today, does 230 est work for everyone?
NickyDynamite [SEP] I can go then, if you still need 1 more
TRex1780 [SEP] That'd be awesome @NickyDynamite ! @Sabre , @Arixama , @Masrim , is 230 est ok for you all?
Arixama [SEP] works for me
Masrim [SEP] Same
Sabre [SEP] yeah 2:30 works for me
Sabre [SEP] sounds like we have a group then. sick
Masrim [SEP] got an hour to kill, anyone want to do NF?
Sabre [SEP] im down. let me log in
Masrim [SEP] Excellent. Want to make it prestige with arc and heavy
Sabre [SEP] i mean im only like 355 or something so idk what the light level is for prestige

https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/20/17596730/destiny-2-secret-exotic-quest-black-spindle-guide
RonInDune [SEP] The reddit post that started it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/90i3cp/io_lost_sector/
Arixama [SEP] I'm currently waiting for the event to spawn. I've already attempted once.
RonInDune [SEP] Oh dang I might join you tomorrow
Arixama [SEP] The unfortunate part is that there's currently no real walkthrough, so I'm trying to figure out which ways to go.
RonInDune [SEP] That's pretty fun, right?  I imagine it's like figuring out the raids...
Arixama [SEP] Definitely, but without having to get a bunch of people together.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yo anyone want to try to do the new event?
Oathbreaker [SEP] @ me if so. Want to try this shit
Arixama [SEP] @Oathbreaker you talking about the hidden thing?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah
Arixama [SEP] i'd be down to attempt it in a little bit, gotta run some errands quick
Sabre [SEP] @Arixama @Oathbreaker im down to do it with you guys
Oathbreaker [SEP] Ari, just @ me when you're ready to go and let's crush this shit
Arixama [SEP] @Oathbreaker logging on now

Oathbreaker [SEP] Can it be done in like 4 minutes?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Or gonna take a little longer?
RonInDune [SEP] Another minute or so
RonInDune [SEP] 150 MB remaining
Oathbreaker [SEP] You're in, 100%. What LL are you out of curiosity?
RonInDune [SEP] Around 365
Oathbreaker [SEP] Perfect! You'll be able to deal damage but it may be a little rough for you in the final room
Oathbreaker [SEP] I've already got Whisper so that should help in some regards
RonInDune [SEP] I'll do my best! What's the recommended gear?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Highest light
Sabre [SEP] Anyone wanting to do whisper? Got myself up to 372 light so hopefully thats enought to contend
xspartinx [SEP] wanyone wanna grind renown with me on titan
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone who would like to do the Whisper mission, please add me on Discord and I would be more than happy to help you through the mission. I already have the weapon but I would be more than happy to help you through the mission!
Aberration [SEP] Hey @Oathbreaker  - I'd love to take a shot at it but I'm also  only around 365 light. I can go melting point titan tho, which may help?
Oathbreaker [SEP] @Aberration We'll take you through for sure!
xspartinx [SEP] @Oathbreaker  when ever you have time
Oathbreaker [SEP] @xspartinx We'll run you through as well. I believe the order is Sabre, you, then Aberration. I'm just doing a few things on my end and I should be logging in around an hour from now.
xspartinx [SEP] i was next last night lmao all good
xspartinx [SEP] jk thanks a ton
Aberration [SEP] I have to go do errands and such as I was traveling all this last week - I'll see if I can get on at a time that works for us all! Obviously don't wait for me but I hope it lines up 😃
Oathbreaker [SEP] We'll see Aberration! If the mission is around in the coming weeks I'll make sure I get to you at some point soon.
Aberration [SEP] Back now
Oathbreaker [SEP] Okay! We still need to run Sabre and Spartan but you're on the list.
Aberration [SEP] Cool cool, ill be grinding out some milestones, have to catch up from the week ahha
xspartinx [SEP] @Oathbreaker  this

Trissin [SEP] Hey all!! Been away from home without access to discord, finally have some internet nkw :))
Trissin [SEP] Seems like I've missed a LOT in d2, like prestige raid lairs and my old friend BLACK SPINDLE
Trissin [SEP] I'm super glad that our clan is more active now !
Arixama [SEP] Spindle anomaly stops being available in 12 hours and opens again sometime next week
Trissin [SEP] Ahhh welp thats ok, I only get home next week anyway
Trissin [SEP] VERY excited to run through it though
Trissin [SEP] as well as finish prestige raid lairs
Arixama [SEP] It's real good. Unless you want to go in blind, I'd recommend watching some videos of at sleast the jumping puzzle.
Trissin [SEP] yeah aha, I've heard the jumping puzzle is pretty troll
Trissin [SEP] I feel like I've missed so much haha
Arixama [SEP] It only got discover on Friday, so at least it wasn't too much.
Trissin [SEP] that's fair, but there is 400 light stuff now!!
Trissin [SEP] And also a bunch of new catalysts, armor reworks, BOUNTIES
Trissin [SEP] hahaha
Trissin [SEP] So much to do lol
Trissin [SEP] if anybody is free sometime next week and willing to help me run thru the black spindle event, lmk!!
Trissin [SEP] I'd also love to get a group going at the prestige raids
Arixama [SEP] @Oathbreaker and I have been running most people through it.
Arixama [SEP] bounties are ok, but only tied to crucible and strikes.
Arixama [SEP] when do you get back?
Trissin [SEP] I'm back on July 30th
Trissin [SEP] A week from now
Trissin [SEP] I heard it's similar to the mission from d1, but tbh I didn't find it too bad!
Trissin [SEP] (in d1)
Arixama [SEP] from what i've heard its a little bit easier cause the last room is more open
Trissin [SEP] ohhhhhh okay cool!
Arixama [SEP] last room is 380, but oath and i have been getting 365's through it in one shot now. we got this.
Trissin [SEP] haha yeah that should be ok!
Trissin [SEP] I'm so excited
Arixama [SEP] i dont know if the ornaments will still be available or not, but theres currently 2 in eververse bundles.
Trissin [SEP] I've also been reading there are a lot of secrets in the quest afterwards?? Like the ship
Trissin [SEP] ah that's fine, I like the taken effect
Arixama [SEP] yeah, once you complete the normal you get a heroic mission on the map
Arixama [SEP] that drops the catalyst, and theres hidden chests and secret stuff that gets you a ship schematic and progress on bot it's catalyst and the sleeper one i believe
Trissin [SEP] ooh sounds cool
Arixama [SEP] have you seen the bosses?
Trissin [SEP] I have not, no
Trissin [SEP] I heard it's the same guy from d1 lol
Trissin [SEP] Uzrok??
Trissin [SEP] Not sure
Arixama [SEP] urzok i think
Arixama [SEP] bullet sponge knight
Trissin [SEP] Weird hive names
Trissin [SEP] oh haha
Trissin [SEP] those are the best kinds of bosses
Arixama [SEP] also valus ta'aurc and a fallen baron(?) from house of wolves
Trissin [SEP] damnnnn, more stuff from HoW!
Trissin [SEP] sweet
Arixama [SEP] baroness, once of the bounties
Trissin [SEP] haha sounds awesome
Trissin [SEP] well I gotta head out for now, but I'm v excited for all this when I'm back
Trissin [SEP] Thanks Ari!
Oathbreaker [SEP] Sorry, was asleep when this convo was going on! Lizard, if you see me online next week whisper me and if I have some time I'll take you through the mission for sure.
Trissin [SEP] yo! Ty so much oathbreaker

_(totally see what you did there... **whisper** you haha)_
Trissin [SEP] I'll show myself out
Oathbreaker [SEP] LMAO. Totally unintended. You missed all the cabal memes and messages I was sending in game to the clan chat to keep people updated. Came to a total of like 6 people we helped over the weekend. Was fun but I don't think I could do that mission for a while 😂
Trissin [SEP] lool damn i was looking forward to some more memes
Trissin [SEP] and Jesus that is a lot of runs
Trissin [SEP] It'll be okay though haha, I've got a friend who wants the spindle as well and hes high enough light for the mission
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah, I sent the Rockets McDickFace strike intro, the Psion Flayers intro, and one other off the top of my head. Was a long 7 hour night for Ari and I hahaha
Arixama [SEP] @here anyone for nightfall?

Masrim [SEP] Mayo can be cold
Arixama [SEP] not like ice cold though
Arixama [SEP] unless you want some mayo ice cubes to go in your drinks
Masrim [SEP] Do we want Solar singe for whisper or arc fit Darci
Arixama [SEP] probably arc
Arixama [SEP] cabal are pretty much all solar damage arent they?

Aberration [SEP] Hey all, if anyone is looking to set up some raids for the end of this week I'm going to have a bunch of time free. Would love to get in on em!
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah that'd be cool. I free on the weekend as well!
Trissin [SEP] yea im down for that!
Trissin [SEP] also looking to do whisper later today
Oathbreaker [SEP] @Trissin Whisper is gone until Friday
Oathbreaker [SEP] It's a Friday daily reset to Monday daily reset
Trissin [SEP] noooooooooooo
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah. I'm gone this weekend too so likely I won't be on to help
Aberration [SEP] Cool cool. It'd be nice to get some stuff done. I still haven't gotten they normal Lev but I'd love a crack at M Coup
Trissin [SEP] ou, yeah the midnight coup is quite good haha
Trissin [SEP] im actually planning to run through leviathan later tonight with some of my friends and i think we've got 1 or 2 spots open
Trissin [SEP] if youre interested we'd love to have ya @Aberration
Aberration [SEP] I'm not sure if I'll be able to. Most weeks I'm pretty booked up on week days...more of a weekend warrior. I'll check it out later ya never know. What time are you going to try?
Trissin [SEP] we were planning to start around 8 ish, but we're very flexible
Trissin [SEP] we can push the time around
Trissin [SEP] what time works for you?
Trissin [SEP] or if you can't run it tonight, that's totally fine too
Aberration [SEP] I'm going out on a limb and just going to guess I'll likely not be able to. It's a bummer I miss out most weeks since my available time table is kind of garbage
Aberration [SEP] Like..it's early morning weekdays and before noon on weekends as best time
Trissin [SEP] ouch those arent very popular times haha
Trissin [SEP] well dont worry about it
Trissin [SEP] i'll definitely run it with ya some other time, when youre free
Aberration [SEP] Sure sure. Wife is out of town this Thursday til next Weds so I have much more available time
Arixama [SEP] @Trissin if you need someone to do leviathan I should be available whenever. I need to get me the calus challenge emblem anyway.
Trissin [SEP] okay @Arixama tyty! we've actually decided to push it to tomorrow since it turns out a couple people couldnt make today
Trissin [SEP] that being said, if we have a spot tomorrow night ill be sure to let u know
Trissin [SEP] meanwhile i am interested in running some more raids in this clan, such as the raid lairs or the prestige raids
Trissin [SEP] i believe there were some people who havent tried the raid lairs or prestige levi yet and I am happy to teach
Helatia [SEP] I'm down for raids tonight if anyone else wants to
Arixama [SEP] @here anyone up for a normal leviathan?
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'd be kind of interested for my Titan. Looking to get an EP group though for the SMG
Arixama [SEP] i just want to get the calus challenge done, it's the last emblem i need
Arixama [SEP] for the challenges
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah, I need it too
Helatia [SEP] I also need that one I think
Arixama [SEP] should we try finding randoms?
Oathbreaker [SEP] I mean, I don't think I'm gonna be able to tonight. Maybe tomorrow night or tomorrow during the day?
Arixama [SEP] tomorrow is reset and the challenge changes doesnt it?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Shit. Wasn't thinking
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah, it will change, which means the next time it will be Calus will be 4 weeks from now. Last week before Forsaken.
Arixama [SEP] i
Arixama [SEP] i'm sure people will be looking for raids. i believe theres some requirement in solstice of heroes to do the challenges for the armor sets?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Maybe? I'm not quite sure.
Arixama [SEP] im hunting region chests right now, cause thats something i gotta do
Oathbreaker [SEP] Snagged the SMG. That's all the EP weapons now thank Christ
Arixama [SEP] gratz. ive got all the region chests, now i just need a spire completion
Oathbreaker [SEP] Same. You busy tomorrow Ari? We could do Spire and some EP stuff. I've got the day off.
Trissin [SEP] nice!!
Trissin [SEP] both haha
Trissin [SEP] sry didnt mean to interrupt lol
Oathbreaker [SEP] Lmao all good dude
Arixama [SEP] i work til 630ish, but after that im free
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone on PC right now want to start grinding through the Solstice activities?
Aberration [SEP] I'd be game for solstice and EP later in the week for sure, Thursday/Friday and on I'll have a ton of time
Aberration [SEP] also does anyone still need to do rat king stuff?
Masrim [SEP] I do.  I think I am at public events
Aberration [SEP] Im still at the first step w/ patrols but I'd be happy to help out to try to bust those out later this wk too
Trissin [SEP] ooh imstill on the last step, nightfall with rat king
Trissin [SEP] or someone else on the same step
Sabre [SEP] @Oathbreaker your arch nemesis
Oathbreaker [SEP] LMAO
Oathbreaker [SEP] Listen I just have this name because why not hahaha
Arixama [SEP] anybody want to solstice?
Masrim [SEP] what is solstice?
Arixama [SEP] the event currently going on.
Masrim [SEP] completely ignorant of anything going on
Arixama [SEP] basically some of the sotry missions got revamped, andyou can get 400 armor . also what the triumph are for
Masrim [SEP] I would like the 400 armor please
Trissin [SEP] _the grind is so real_
Masrim [SEP] I'm guessing it's not solo content
Arixama [SEP] it can be
Arixama [SEP] it's harder solo though
Masrim [SEP] But I kick ass. Unless there's jumping involved
Masrim [SEP] Well I have an hour and a half of anyone's game
Arixama [SEP] we can run through the missions, cause those seem like the hardest requirements as far as i've gotten so far
Masrim [SEP] I am in front of the homecoming lady
Trissin [SEP] hey all, if anybody else is free and interested i'd like to run a raid tonight with our clan
Arixama [SEP] I'm definitely down.
Trissin [SEP] if anybody still requires completions of eow, spire, or any prestige raids for solstice/triumphs i'd be down to go thru it
RonInDune [SEP] Oh heck yeah, I'll be free tonight after a while, so I'm down for any raid!
Arixama [SEP] I need a spire completion. I'm only on the blue armor for solstice so I don't know what the later requirements are
RonInDune [SEP] I haven't been in the game for a few days so i still have to check out the solstice stuff
Trissin [SEP] well, if you aspire to be a farmer then solstice is for you!
Trissin [SEP] it's pretty cool stuff but there is a lot of grinding
Trissin [SEP] :((
RonInDune [SEP] Well I did like farming in ARPGs so I may or may not hate myself for doing this
Trissin [SEP] lool
Trissin [SEP] well in regards to the solstice event, i dont think any of the armor requires completion of spire

but there is a triumph unlock for 20 points which requires you to complete EOW and spire @Arixama
Trissin [SEP] i would be interested in doing spire tonight
Arixama [SEP] That's the only raid I need for the triumph. I'm gonna get me all the everything.
Trissin [SEP] even the exotic ship?? 😮
Arixama [SEP] thats the one for getting all the armor right?
Trissin [SEP] Yeah
Trissin [SEP] So much farming
Arixama [SEP] if i managed to do all the faction rallys this season i think i can do this?
Arixama [SEP] i hope
Trissin [SEP] :o you got 50 on all 3???
Arixama [SEP] yeah
Oathbreaker [SEP] When is the raid gonna be? I have family over tonight but might be able to log on for an EOW
Trissin [SEP] yo! I don't have a strict timeframe, I can be on when it's convenient for the rest of the group
Arixama [SEP] im good whenever
Trissin [SEP] okay cool
Trissin [SEP] @Oathbreaker what times are good for u?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Not too sure. Dinner is at 6:30 EST and that might be a little while. Girlfriend is also over so I might not be able to tonight
Trissin [SEP] okok dont stress it
Arixama [SEP] anyone up for redux missions?
Trissin [SEP] alright so I've got two friends who would like to try spire for their first time tonight
Trissin [SEP] forewarning however they are a bit cancerous
Arixama [SEP] that's fine, my mic has a mute function
Helatia [SEP] I can help with raids. Haven't done any prestiege though. I'm good all day
Helatia [SEP] just farming solstice right now
Trissin [SEP] alright cool, that makes 5
Trissin [SEP] actually wait, if ron is joining us then we have 6 i believe
Trissin [SEP] just to make sure, if we are doing spire then you should be around 365+ light
Arixama [SEP] im good
Arixama [SEP] 385
Helatia [SEP] 385 also
Trissin [SEP] perfect
RonInDune [SEP] I'm 370
RonInDune [SEP] But when exactly are we starting?
Trissin [SEP] does 8:15 work for everyone?
Arixama [SEP] cst?
Trissin [SEP] 8:15 est would be 7:15 cst
Trissin [SEP] we can push it back
Arixama [SEP] ok, i thought you were est but i couldnt remember
Arixama [SEP] just making sure i knew the right time
Trissin [SEP] 👍
Arixama [SEP] i'm so close to the 400 armor
Trissin [SEP] same here, just a few minor things
Arixama [SEP] i need 3 of the missions, nightfall and adventures
Arixama [SEP] and 5 crucible wins
Trissin [SEP] The 5 crucible wins took me a while haha
Trissin [SEP] Ive got 1 story, nightfall, 3 heroic strikes, and the adventures
Trissin [SEP] just gonna ping @RonInDune and @Helatia , does 8:15 work?
Trissin [SEP] ~45 minutes from now
Arixama [SEP] i can get me a tshirt now
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I'm good at that time
Arixama [SEP] helatia says hes good too
Trissin [SEP] sweet
Trissin [SEP] invites are out @Arixama @Helatia
Masrim [SEP] do I have to do this stuff for each character?
Masrim [SEP] Heroic strike at 279 light is not fun
Arixama [SEP] why are you doing heroic strikes at such a low light?
Arixama [SEP] if your going for the elemental orbs, you can just do regular strikes
Trissin [SEP] it seems that elemental orbs drop more often from majors, apparently a good way to farm them is to load up the nightfall and kill the yellow-bar goblins at the start and just keep repeating that
Trissin [SEP] or so i've heard
Sabre [SEP] Zeta and I just got the Legendary 405 gear. I'm not gonna be around this weekend, but after that if anyone is looking to grind out masterworks let me know
Aberration [SEP] anyone looking to grind anything out tonight? Havent logged in since reset, blank canvas here
Aberration [SEP] I have ~1 hour of class right now but afterwards im good
RonInDune [SEP] I though we might try the spire raid again if we have time and numbers. We got super close last night!
Trissin [SEP] whisper anybody? :))
Aberration [SEP] I still need to go for that catalyst... Won't be out of work til later tho
Peronix [SEP] I'm down for the whisper quest whoever wants to do it
Masrim [SEP] How hard is the catalyst mission? Lots of jumping again?
thegoaliebear [SEP] it's the exact same mission. get the chests+oracles first then load back into it and complete it.
Arixama [SEP] Higher light though
thegoaliebear [SEP] you'll still get one shot don't worry lmao.
Arixama [SEP] Do you need a full fireteam for the chests and oracles? Or is that doable alone?
thegoaliebear [SEP] you can do those alone.
RonInDune [SEP] Where are the chests? When I went through it for the first time I didn't see a single chest...
Trissin [SEP] they are hiddne
RonInDune [SEP] Figures
Trissin [SEP] haha yeah the map is so big, i cant imagine how people ever found all of them
Arixama [SEP] Especially as fast as they did
Trissin [SEP] yeah, kinda crazy haha
Trissin [SEP] im so close to finishing the armor, just need to do the arms
Trissin [SEP] heroic strikes woo
Arixama [SEP] I need prestige raid, highscore nightfall and heroic strikes
Trissin [SEP] i can help you out with some of those
Trissin [SEP] lets see if we can get a group together for the prestige raid
Trissin [SEP] and we'll definitely need a third for the nightfall
Aberration [SEP] id be game for NF
Arixama [SEP] I'm afraid of the prestige raid.
thegoaliebear [SEP] @RonInDune if you look in the pinned messages in #destiny-spoilers we have videos of where each chest is as well as the order to shoot the three waves of oracles.
Trissin [SEP] haha the prestige raid isn't bad @Arixama !
Arixama [SEP] I'll be home here soon
Trissin [SEP] really its okay
RonInDune [SEP] @thegoaliebear Thanks!
Arixama [SEP] You have to switch runners in gauntlet, right?
Aberration [SEP] im game for whatever - ll around 365-370
Trissin [SEP] yeah you have to switch roles in gauntlet
Trissin [SEP] dont worry its not bad
Helatia [SEP] It's pretty easy
Helatia [SEP] Yeet
Aberration [SEP] Im not sure if im sold on grinding out the armor on every char, seems like something thats gonna be replaced in a month or so
Helatia [SEP] do it for the ship!
Arixama [SEP] wait til next week though
Arixama [SEP] mayhem is back and will make the super kills some much less painful
Aberration [SEP] hmm
Aberration [SEP] yea
Helatia [SEP] true.
Masrim [SEP] How do you get to the spoiler talk
Aberration [SEP] you gotta watch a new movie before everyone else and ruin it for them
Masrim [SEP] The mission was possible
Helatia [SEP] Snape kills dumbledore
Masrim [SEP] Henry Cavill is the bad guy
Helatia [SEP] Bruce Willis is dead the whole time
Masrim [SEP] IRL?
Helatia [SEP] 6th sense
Masrim [SEP] ;)
Aberration [SEP] orbs are love, orbs are life
Aberration [SEP] i mean its not as rough as faction rally
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Masrim you didn't have the `spoilers enabled` role but I added it to you. you should be able to see the spoiler channel now.
Aberration [SEP] see...told you if you spoiled enough movies you'd get in
Helatia [SEP] @thegoaliebear  How about hooking me up as well? 😃
thegoaliebear [SEP] sure👍
Helatia [SEP] you tha bomb
Arixama [SEP] @PC if anyone needs whisper i've got the portal
Helatia [SEP] prestiege or regular?
Arixama [SEP] regular. heroic is just on the map
Helatia [SEP] oh right
Arixama [SEP] if you need to do heroic, i dont have the catalyst yet
Helatia [SEP] I'm down after this adventure
Peronix [SEP] I’m down as well
Helatia [SEP] Sweet!
Trissin [SEP] anybody down for heroic strikes?
Helatia [SEP] It's solar, glass, and melee today btw.
Trissin [SEP] ah well
Trissin [SEP] no matter
Trissin [SEP] if not its fine
Masrim [SEP] I tried to add it. Thanks goal
Masrim [SEP] ahh whos down for some destiny
Masrim [SEP] never thought of this before, but is discord free?  not for users, but for hosts
Trissin [SEP] yep, it's free to host servers
RonInDune [SEP] @Masrim Destiny is overrated! All the cool kids these days play only Duke Nukem Forever.
Arixama [SEP] That's why it's called Forever!
Trissin [SEP] finally got that emblem!! 400 triumph points _woo_
RonInDune [SEP] Congrats @Trissin ! That must have taken some grinding skills!
Trissin [SEP] lol thanks ron! it actualy wasnt as bad as i'd imagined
Trissin [SEP] i have to say, the green solstice armor set is very misleading
Trissin [SEP] after the green is smooth riding
Aberration [SEP] Green makes me rage. Anyone looking to raid or anything fancy tonight? I'd be happy to join in
Trissin [SEP] Id be down! Anything you wanted to do in particular @Aberration ?
Trissin [SEP] correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall you hadn't done all the raids yet?
Aberration [SEP] Well... I've never finished Leviathan got to Baths before we stopped. I've done EoW all the way, but haven't stepped in SoS at all.
Aberration [SEP] I'm game for whatever honestly. I'm not picky I'm more in it for the experience/a little challenge
RonInDune [SEP] I might be down for eater of worlds in around 45 mins
Aberration [SEP] Works for me!
Trissin [SEP] @RonInDune this will be your first eater right?
RonInDune [SEP] Yup yup
Trissin [SEP] okay cool, yeah
Trissin [SEP] we'll do eater of worlds starting at 8:15 est (7:15 cst) then
RonInDune [SEP] Yay!
Aberration [SEP] Cool cool. I'll log on in a few, playing some SNES right now haha
Trissin [SEP] 👍 👍
Trissin [SEP] I've got +1 as well, so we have 4 in total now
Trissin [SEP] 2 more at 815 pls
Masrim [SEP] I was stressing about the green because I thought we only had until Tuesday morning to get it done
Trissin [SEP] lool
Trissin [SEP] alright so we got 4 people for eow
Trissin [SEP] @PC doing a fresh run of EOW, no experience necessary at all, we have 2 spots open!
Trissin [SEP] anybody want to run it with us?
Peronix [SEP] I can, but I won’t be on till around 9. But y’all can go ahead if that’s too lare
Peronix [SEP] Late
Trissin [SEP] im okay with postponing till 9, is that okay with u @RonInDune ?
Trissin [SEP] and @Aberration
Aberration [SEP] I can be on a titan or lock, whatever the raid needs
Aberration [SEP] and thats fine i have free time tonight
RonInDune [SEP] It's perfect actually! My code was still compiling and I needed a few more minutes.
Trissin [SEP] okay sweet
RonInDune [SEP] SO that's like 40 mins from now?
Trissin [SEP] yep
Trissin [SEP] awesome
Trissin [SEP] can we get 1 more for EOW in 30 minutes? @PC
Masrim [SEP] WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME
Masrim [SEP] ack
Aberration [SEP] 5 dolla
Masrim [SEP] Venmo it over
RonInDune [SEP] I can teach you how to fly a kite.
Masrim [SEP] I live near power lines! Are you trying to kill me?!?
RonInDune [SEP] Think on the bright side, you might discover electricity! And become a new Ben Franklin for our age!
Peronix [SEP] Oh, sorry I forgot to mention I’m in Central time.  Y’all can go ahead though
Aberration [SEP] shheeeeeit
Trissin [SEP] riiiip
RonInDune [SEP] Well we can try early tomorrow maybe?
RonInDune [SEP] I'm free more or less the entire day
Trissin [SEP] i think we can get a run going tonight
RonInDune [SEP] Oh that'd be fantastic
TRex1780 [SEP] Still need another for EOW?
Aberration [SEP] I think so
Masrim [SEP] Hmm so I am in home coming but there is this big white barrier keeping me from progressing
Aberration [SEP] gotta clear everything
Aberration [SEP] or maybe it glitched :mind_blown:
Masrim [SEP] The only thing left is in the other side of the barrier lol
Aberration [SEP] RIP
Trissin [SEP] oh yeah
Trissin [SEP] thats happened to me a lot
Trissin [SEP] jump down and go to the left
Masrim [SEP] I tried going around. Just killed myself. See if that works
RonInDune [SEP] I found the enemy placements and stuff are a bit different
RonInDune [SEP] Also, is it just me or is my Ghost not speaking at all?
Aberration [SEP] nope hes quiet
RonInDune [SEP] ah good I though I messed up my settings
RonInDune [SEP] oops sorry mispaste
Trissin [SEP] so @TRex1780 are you good to join us?
TRex1780 [SEP] I'm good! I'm in orbit now and ready to go
Trissin [SEP] awesome
RonInDune [SEP] I'll be online in 2 minutes
Masrim [SEP] Can peronix replace me once he is on
Trissin [SEP] I don't think it will be a very long run....
Trissin [SEP] @Peronix
Masrim [SEP] where are we chatting
Trissin [SEP] im going to inv
Trissin [SEP] i sent u a friend request @Masrim
Trissin [SEP] alright, we got thru eow and now we're gonna run leviathan
Trissin [SEP] we just need 1 person
Trissin [SEP] @PC
Trissin [SEP] anybody interested in leviathan tonight?
AY AY RON [SEP] normal ?
Trissin [SEP] yep, normal
AY AY RON [SEP] yeah i'll join for normal
Trissin [SEP] okay sweet
AY AY RON [SEP] Shooshi16#1499
AY AY RON [SEP] my btag
MrGommyBoy [SEP] ill do leviathan
Aberration [SEP] Im totally up for another round of levi today if we have a few takers.
Trissin [SEP] im good for that as well
Masrim [SEP] Anyone need heavy strikes done?  Im going to pound a few out
Aberration [SEP] heading uptown for a few but if any raid-esque things start to form I'm down in an hour or so
Aberration [SEP] @Masrim if you're still looking to do some strikes i have a few that I need to run
Masrim [SEP] I'm in 1au right now if you want to jump in
Aberration [SEP] will need about 10 or so, but maybe then if you're still there haha
Aberration [SEP] Power just cut out will be on in a min
Masrim [SEP] I already took your spot
xspartinx [SEP] any  wanna do soh with me
Aberration [SEP] Ended up mowing my lawn. I'm still looking to hit some nightfall tonight if anyone is game in 30-45m?
Nazgul [SEP] yea im in, send me an invite when you sign back on
Aberration [SEP] Cool cool. Sorry I am taking longer than expected
Aberration [SEP] @PC anyone for NF - need 1 more
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah, hang on
Aberration [SEP] kk
xspartinx [SEP] need 1 for heroic whisper
we did oracles just need it cleared
Trissin [SEP] hey guys, so my friend danny (littlepants) wants to do a prestige leviathan before the reset, and i believe some other people in our clan also need the completion for the solstice masterwork
Trissin [SEP] is anybody interested in running a prestige leviathan starting around 8pm est (7pm cst) tonight?
Trissin [SEP] @PC
Aberration [SEP] What's the LL required for that?
Aberration [SEP] If I can help, I will
Trissin [SEP] I believe it's still 300, if you are higher than that then you will just be scaled down
Trissin [SEP] regardless of light ads will hurt a **lot**
Trissin [SEP] it's mostly a matter of mechanics
Masrim [SEP] You only need to wear the solstice armor to create orbs right?  Don't need to wear it on crucible
Trissin [SEP] yeah, wearing the full set is just to generate orbs
Trissin [SEP] you can just wear individual pieces for the specific objectives
Masrim [SEP] That's good to know
Aberration [SEP] I'm willing to help out with the Levi, but fair warning I've only completed it fully once (this week first time haha) but it did go pretty smooth ;)
Aberration [SEP] I'd love to do it on my Titan for the milestone but I don't have any raid gear on him yet womp womp
Trissin [SEP] I think you played perfectly fine @Aberration , very well for first completion haha
Trissin [SEP] You're more than welcome to join
Aberration [SEP] Great! Sign me up then. Barring any unforeseen circumstances I should be available
Trissin [SEP] sweet! Anybody else for prestige Leviathan tonight? I believe @Arixama and @Helatia expressed some interest a while ago but I might be misremembering
Helatia [SEP] You can sign me up! I think Ari is working tonight, though @Trissin
RonInDune [SEP] I wish I could come in tonight! Best of luck guys.
Trissin [SEP] Okay gotcha @Helatia , thanks! Also thank you Ron, we'll definitely be doing more runs of prestige levi in the weeks to come for everybody who needs a completion or is just interested in joining :))
Aberration [SEP] I need to bust out those soh armor sets
Aberration [SEP] If anyone needs blue missions I'll likely be on those steps this week
Helatia [SEP] I close tonight so I won't be home until around 9 central
Arixama [SEP] I'm actually on a short vacation, so I won't be back on until possibly late Wednesday night or thursday evening
AY AY RON [SEP] i'll probably be down for prestige some time in the future, currently waiting for mayhem to do more soh armor requirements
Masrim [SEP] i hate crucible, just saying
Masrim [SEP] I feel so bad for my team
Masrim [SEP] Any weapon suggestions
Masrim [SEP] Do you think they messed up and it was supposed to be 10 super kills and 30 guardian
Masrim [SEP] And they just don't want to admit they fucked up
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Trissin not sure what you do at prestige calus, but we have two people fixed in the throne room by having only the shadow realm people punch the psions. makes things a lot less hectic.
Trissin [SEP] oh okay, i gotchu
Trissin [SEP] yeah i think that might be a good strat to do, we'll see how it goes
Trissin [SEP] thank you fearless clan mother
RonInDune [SEP] All hail!
Aberration [SEP] Crucible steps for green SOH armor makes me cringe so hard
Aberration [SEP] im about to embark on that
Trissin [SEP] noooo wait for mayhem tomorrow
Aberration [SEP] Ehhh yeaaa
Aberration [SEP] probably should
Trissin [SEP] finish all the other green objectives but leave the guardian and super kills
Aberration [SEP] gotta warm up my grav lance for maximum meta trolling
Trissin [SEP] loool
Aberration [SEP] For the rec, I can't stay up super super long tonight since I have to work in the AM - 9 cst may be a bit late for me :\
Masrim [SEP] Ugh 5 hours PvP 37% super kills. Suck+Hunter= torture
Trissin [SEP] :(((
Masrim [SEP] Can someone log onto my account and do it for me lol
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Trissin lol no problem. it just makes it easy to optimize the shadow team for damage. that way the two in throne room can use their supers freely and really focus on adds instead of having to worry about punching a psion as well.
RonInDune [SEP] Anyone up for some heroic strikes?
Trissin [SEP] hey all, sorry I know we were going to do a run through of prestige leviathan tonight but there's a storm right above my place rn and my power's already gone out 3 times today
Trissin [SEP] not to mention there also seems to be some timing issues since people are away and busy
Trissin [SEP] you're more than welcome to continue with the run but I don't think my power+internet are reliable enough for tonight, i'll be running it another time
Trissin [SEP] sorry @Aberration and @Helatia
Aberration [SEP] Woof!
Aberration [SEP] maybe next week
Aberration [SEP] guess that means I'll be grinding SoH.... 💀
Helatia [SEP] It's all good. It happens
Sabre [SEP] anyone up to run EoW?
Trissin [SEP] im farming solstice stuff right now, how about later @Sabre ?
Aberration [SEP] Anyone game for some NF?
Trissin [SEP] littlepants and I need to do nf, but littlepants needs to get his blue first
Aberration [SEP] Cool cool. I need to get on that too...but the crucible. Blah
Aberration [SEP] it makes me so sad
Trissin [SEP] :(((
Aberration [SEP] so do we not the full set of SOH gear in crucible?
Trissin [SEP] So if we were to run a prestige leviathan tomorrow night, who would be available for that?
RonInDune [SEP] I probably will, but I can't confirm until around 4 PM tomorrow
Aberration [SEP] I don't think I will :(
Aberration [SEP] I'm gonna be back to weekend duty most likely
Peronix [SEP] I'm down if you don't mind me having limited experience with the raid
Sabre [SEP] hey id be down and im sure Zeta would be too
Trissin [SEP] hmm... how much experience do you have @Peronix
Peronix [SEP] I’ve done the room with the patrolling war beasts, the room with the three staffs, and a little of the baths
Trissin [SEP] hmm... what light are you?
Trissin [SEP] also, have @Sabre or zeta completed prestige leviathan before?
Trissin [SEP] might be a bit of a challenge with 5 people who havent done it before
Trissin [SEP] we can give it a shot though
Trissin [SEP] how does starting tonight at 8 EST sound?
Peronix [SEP] Right now 352 but I’m grinding the solstice armor for 400 and almost got it done. Just need Crucible wins and some more arc super kills
Trissin [SEP] oh yeah thats high enough
Trissin [SEP] finally got the ship!!!!
Trissin [SEP] my god
Trissin [SEP] what a grind
RonInDune [SEP] Congrats dude! Does it look good?
Trissin [SEP] yaaaassss it looks cool!!
Sabre [SEP] hey sorry, i ended up being busy last night so i couldnt join in. Im trying to grind the ship out too its tough
Trissin [SEP] dont worry about it!
Trissin [SEP] all good 👍
Sabre [SEP] alright haha im trying to cram in as much of this event as I can cause im gonna be busy so much during it between moving to school and being out of town for a week on top of that
Trissin [SEP] yeeep yeah haha
Trissin [SEP] how are far are you on your solstice armor sets?
Sabre [SEP] about halfway through the second scorched set. Hopefully will have it mostly done with Rekindled by tomorrow. I finished the entire first set in 2 days so if I need to reproduce that grind, I will lol
Sabre [SEP] I love the Estival Excursion too much to pass it up
Trissin [SEP] jesus , 2 days
Sabre [SEP] I had to play through the story on a third character cause I didnt have a titan yet
Trissin [SEP] impressive haha
Sabre [SEP] yeah haha it was brutal but it worked
Trissin [SEP] oh no
Trissin [SEP] well let us know if you need help with any of the solstice stuff, im sure we'll be able to help out
Sabre [SEP] will do for sure, I appreciate it
Masrim [SEP] I could use some help on solstice
Trissin [SEP] soooo does anybody want to do the prestige leviathan tonight? @PC
RonInDune [SEP] Yup
Peronix [SEP] Roger
Trissin [SEP] great, that would make 4 with littlepants and I
Trissin [SEP] 2 more for prestige leviathan?
Sabre [SEP] Ah darn I would have but I just made plans to go out with a couple friends
Arixama [SEP] @TheCnC and I would be down
Arixama [SEP] To attempt at least
Trissin [SEP] okay, awesome
Trissin [SEP] are we all good to go right now? @RonInDune @Peronix @Arixama @TheCnC
TheCnC [SEP] Give us like 10?
RonInDune [SEP] Oh sure I'm coming online
Peronix [SEP] I’m good to go
Trissin [SEP] sweet, we'll just wait for cnc and ari
RonInDune [SEP] Oh I also have the keys remaining  from last night's raid
Trissin [SEP] oh yeah, right, we need to do that before tuesday
Trissin [SEP] ty for reminding me
RonInDune [SEP] Alright when are we starting?
Trissin [SEP] just waiting on @Arixama and @RonInDune
RonInDune [SEP] I'm ready
Trissin [SEP] go ahead and join up on me in orbit
TheCnC [SEP] will do getting in now
Trissin [SEP] okay sweet
TheCnC [SEP] ari should be shortly behind me
RonInDune [SEP] Coming up now
Trissin [SEP] okay we're in the voice chat
Oathbreaker [SEP] Good luck guys!
Trissin [SEP] thanks!!
RonInDune [SEP] Thanks for a fantastic raid guys! I apologize for being whiny towards the end, but we got it!
Arixama [SEP] it was a long one and we all got a bit whiny, its definitely ok
Aberration [SEP] Trying to bust out a blue set this weekend. Anyone want to do nightfall in a few hours or maybe tmrw?
Trissin [SEP] @Aberration is it just completion or the highscore run?
Aberration [SEP] It's just completion. I believe...
Aberration [SEP] Blue warlock set
Trissin [SEP] oh okay we can run that easily
Trissin [SEP] just let me know when you're on
Aberration [SEP] Sweet deal. Thanks much! I'm taking a half day today so I'll probably be on in a few hrs
Trissin [SEP] 👍
Arixama [SEP] i work at 2 cst, so if its before then i can help
Oathbreaker [SEP] @Arixama I just got weasel'd and now have to wait a few thousand years to log back in
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone know how to take screenshots of D2 stuff?
Masrim [SEP] Guess you're not playing this afternoon
Sabre [SEP] Howd the prestige run go last night?
Aberration [SEP] hey gang, anyone up for that NF?
Aberration [SEP] that is, if you can login within the next millenia?
Trissin [SEP] lol RIP @Oathbreaker
Trissin [SEP] btw im good for that nightfall @Aberration
Sabre [SEP] hey lmfao so Zeta didnt know this was a text channel because the i think the role assign bot is offline
Trissin [SEP] oh no lol!
Trissin [SEP] i just gave him the role
Trissin [SEP] he should be able to see this channel now
Aberration [SEP] i'm in game, ready to go when you are bud - thanks for the help 😃
Trissin [SEP] haha welcome to our pc chat @zetaa !
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'll jump in the NF
zetaa [SEP] is this the secret channel youve all been hiding from me
Sabre [SEP] he was like man i wish we had a general chat for just PC players and i was like oh we just use the lfg channel and he had no idea what i was talking about lmaoo
Trissin [SEP] rest in pepperoni
Trissin [SEP] its okay hes here now
Aberration [SEP] Whats up homies.  Anyone need H Strikes or NF?
Masrim [SEP] I could probably do some, still on greens though
Masrim [SEP] So much easier I might get all 3 chars done today in a couple hours
Masrim [SEP] 37 to 87 in 20 min. The first 37 took hours. Haha
Masrim [SEP] Yay blue on one
Aberration [SEP] Im doing missions now
Aberration [SEP] @Masrim if you want in
Masrim [SEP] Cool. I'll jump in
Masrim [SEP] Hate trying to grind orbs in strikes and the other 2 people don't have any master works
Trissin [SEP] :(((
Arixama [SEP] Just load up the nightfall and goring the first area.
Arixama [SEP] Grind*
Trissin [SEP] ^^
this works
Arixama [SEP] I killed everything but the Knights, got the orbs, let the knights kill me, repeat.
Masrim [SEP] Wish I knew that before haha.  2 sets blue now. 1 to go
Arixama [SEP] Are you grinding all the greens first?
Masrim [SEP] Yeah
Masrim [SEP] Almost finished all 3
Arixama [SEP] It's such a weird grind scale
Masrim [SEP] Sure is
Aberration [SEP] Got my purple on lock today. Pretty happy about that. Working on Titan now will need to do all redux for blues if you need them Masrim
Oathbreaker [SEP] Need to do Green on my Titan. If I do it fast enough I'm considering leveling up a Warlock
Oathbreaker [SEP] So it turns out I need to do the crucible milestone to get Mayhem. Well.
Oathbreaker [SEP] This sucks.
Masrim [SEP] Yeah. Have to do 2 quick and 2 competitive.  The comp goes fast if you get survival
Masrim [SEP] Finally found something good about The nokris strike. Great for orbs
Oathbreaker [SEP] I fucking hate crucible so fucking much. I don't enjoy this at all.
Oathbreaker [SEP] I used to be able to play so well in D1 but it feels so different that I just can't do a damn thing.
Aberration [SEP] Crucible makes me rage
Aberration [SEP] It's antifun for the most part
Oathbreaker [SEP] It's so antifun for me.
Masrim [SEP] I didn't mind mayhem
Oathbreaker [SEP] Mayhem is fine for me because it's chaos but expected chaos. Quickplay can be horrible and don't get me started on competitive.
Masrim [SEP] Finally. All 3 green done. Fuck you orbs
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm hoping to get Titan Green Armor before weekly reset
Masrim [SEP] Can you mix green and blue in missions. I mean 1 person with green one with blue
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yes
Oathbreaker [SEP] And get the person with Green to start them
Oathbreaker [SEP] For some reason they seem easier
Arixama [SEP] anybody for a heroic whisper completion?
xspartinx [SEP] anyone help me with whisper quick so i can get cat done
Sabre [SEP] If you can manage to have a green set, you can put it on to start the easier mission, then switch to blue. Idk how to have green and blue at the same time but that's what I've heard. Maybe get the green and vault it or put it on another char until you upgrade to blue?
Arixama [SEP] You vault it. Tested it the other night.
Aberration [SEP] Dang protips
Arixama [SEP] Anybody looking to do so missions?
Masrim [SEP] So you vault your blue?  Or do you have to vault your green and get another green
Arixama [SEP] Vault your greens, then interact with the statue.
Masrim [SEP] What if all you have is Blues
Arixama [SEP] Then youre screwed.
Masrim [SEP] Why didn't you tell me this yesterday
Arixama [SEP] But if you party up with someone with greens, and have them start the missions that works.
RonInDune [SEP] I'm still all green, so I can join in in about 30 minutes
Masrim [SEP] I'm trying to get on abberat ion and Ron
Arixama [SEP] I've also got greens I need to do missions for
Oathbreaker [SEP] Need to do some missions myself. Still on Green Titan Armor lol. Got the crucible done though
Aberration [SEP] I will have a bunch of time tmrw around 6est
Aberration [SEP] The most magical thing happened this morning - 5 win streak in crucible to knock out the blue req for my titan
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Trissin [SEP] congrats!!!
Aberration [SEP] It was the best. Anyone need those Redux missions?
Arixama [SEP] i do
Aberration [SEP] Great
Aberration [SEP] I gotta whip up some dinner real quick, want to bust em out in 30-40m?
Arixama [SEP] definitely
Aberration [SEP] nice
Aberration [SEP] OK im about ready took me an hour D:
Aberration [SEP] sry bout that
Arixama [SEP] not a problem
RonInDune [SEP] Can I join in?
Aberration [SEP] oh yeah sure
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I just ragequit out of the first chosen mission haha
Aberration [SEP] haha yeah they're a bunch of fun
Masrim [SEP] who wants to rock and roll
Trissin [SEP] alright, round 2, any interest in prestige leviathan?
Trissin [SEP] mango, littlepants and I will be doing prestige leviathan tomorrow night
Trissin [SEP] no exp necessary, mango has never completed prestige before
Trissin [SEP] good chance to masterwork the chestpiece 👍
Arixama [SEP] what time you guys thinking?
Trissin [SEP] for now it's about 8 ET, so 7 CST but we're very flexible with the time
Trissin [SEP] we can push it back and forth
Arixama [SEP] i should be able to join if you need me
Trissin [SEP] gotcha, ty ari
Arixama [SEP] no problem. if theres someone who needs it for the masterwork, they definitely have priority over me cause ive got it.
RonInDune [SEP] I won't have good internet where I'll be, so I'll have to skip. Good luck!
Trissin [SEP] thanks ron! 2 more for prestige leviathan tonight at 8 ET (7 cst)?
Masrim [SEP] Wish I had my legendary set done. Getting close though
Trissin [SEP] sweet!
Trissin [SEP] do u need any help with it?
Masrim [SEP] I think I'm pretty much done on the one. Just need to run chosen. Melee kills grenade kills and crucible
Trissin [SEP] oh ok
Trissin [SEP] lmk if u need a hand
Masrim [SEP] Will do.  Going to try to get this one done tonight. Except for crucible
Masrim [SEP] Then move onto my other one that is partially done
Masrim [SEP] Trying to get all 3 legendary before the 28th. No idea why since it is moot in September
Arixama [SEP] obviously for the ship
Trissin [SEP] ^
Arixama [SEP] also, for your melee kills, get yourself a sword that the same energy type, empty it ammo, and then kills will count.
Masrim [SEP] Ship?
Masrim [SEP] Oh yeah
Trissin [SEP] I think that only works for Hunter and Titan
Trissin [SEP] The sword thing
Masrim [SEP] Nice
Trissin [SEP] If you're Warlock you can use apotheosis veil and sparrow to refill melee
Masrim [SEP] I just run around Nessus and punch things. That place with the big jump has a constant spawn
Masrim [SEP] But not a huge one so it gets overwhelming
Masrim [SEP] Any good places for grenade kills?
Arixama [SEP] which class?
Masrim [SEP] This one is Titan. But I have to do all 3
Masrim [SEP] I wish I was still unemployed lol
Arixama [SEP] titan is arc grenade kills, right?
Trissin [SEP] insurmountable helps a ton
Masrim [SEP] I think so
Arixama [SEP] i still need chosen and spark for my last set legendaries if you need help
Masrim [SEP] Sounds like a date!  Tonight around 8?
Arixama [SEP] depends on if they need me for the prestige run, but if they dont, definitely.
Masrim [SEP] Ok sounds good. Either way I need then both for my other 2. So whenever you need it
Masrim [SEP] So I got a really good deal on an iPad for my wife.  Ordered it and got a cover too since the price was good.
Masrim [SEP] Cover and iPad are shipping separately
Masrim [SEP] Cover requires signature for delivery
Masrim [SEP] iPad does not require signature
Masrim [SEP] Wtf!
Aberration [SEP] seems legit
Trissin [SEP] btw @Arixama we are not going to do the raid tonight
Arixama [SEP] Alright, good to know! Works pretty well cause my parenta want to go out to dinner.
Masrim [SEP] um, I thought I was plan b
Arixama [SEP] When I get home, definitely. Shouldn't be too long of a time.
Masrim [SEP] You eating pizza again
Arixama [SEP] i promise i eat things other than pizza
Aberration [SEP] whoooo still needs redux missions?
Masrim [SEP] I need some. I think most on my Warlock and 1 on my Hunter . I need nf on all 3.
Masrim [SEP] On a good note I got a BD from crucible last night
Aberration [SEP] nice! BD will be good looking forward
Aberration [SEP] i have 1 more H Strike that im on right now then if you want to bust out a mission or 2 I'd be happy to
Aberration [SEP] just finished
Masrim [SEP] Won't be on for a bit. Need to walk the dog then see what the wife has planned for me
Aberration [SEP] Gotcha
Masrim [SEP] i have escaped her clutches momentarily
Masrim [SEP] anyone down for a NF?
Aberration [SEP] @Masrim im back, up for any redux?
Trissin [SEP] wondering if anybody here still needs a completion of prestige leviathan? @PC
Trissin [SEP] MangoHead and LittlePants still need to do a run, I'd like to do it with them some time this week
Trissin [SEP] please let me know if interested! we'd appreciate the help, no prestige exp necessary :))
Sabre [SEP] I need to do one at some point before the event ends.
Trissin [SEP] we'd love to have ya
Aberration [SEP] I might be able to help out. Depends on timing of course
RonInDune [SEP] I'll be available on Sunday evening onwards...
Thawxtem [SEP] I’d love to go, but I won’t know my Sunday schedule until tomorrow evening
Bobthedog [SEP] @Trissin is stil need a completion i have done all the encounters tho
Trissin [SEP] okay yeah thats fine @Bobthedog !
Bobthedog [SEP] Whens the run?
Trissin [SEP] haven't decided on a time yet, haha
Trissin [SEP] are you good with tonight or tomorrow night? around 8pm est
Thawxtem [SEP] If that’s the case, is there still room for one more?
Trissin [SEP] yep!
Trissin [SEP] that should be a full team
Trissin [SEP] hey! are you guys good @Bobthedog @Thawxtem
Bobthedog [SEP] I actually cant sorry thanks for invite
Trissin [SEP] alright... is anybody open to running a prestige leviathan tonight @PC ?
Thawxtem [SEP] Finishing dinner @Trissin
Sabre [SEP] What time are you thinking?
Trissin [SEP] no worries @Thawxtem !
Trissin [SEP] actually i was thinking of doing it tonight @Sabre
Thawxtem [SEP] I think he was asking the hour, not the day
Trissin [SEP] i think in about 15 minutes @Sabre
Trissin [SEP] do u need to push it back?
Thawxtem [SEP] So at x:30?
Thawxtem [SEP] So at x:30?
Thawxtem [SEP] Invite me when you’re ready. I’m going to be doing Flashpoint: Titan
Trissin [SEP] will do!
Trissin [SEP] are you okay to join us tonight @Sabre ?
Thawxtem [SEP] Do you know if there are any special ghost abilities for Levithan?
Trissin [SEP] special ghost abilities?
Thawxtem [SEP] Ex: “gain 10% more XP while in strikes” is on my ghost
Trissin [SEP] oh
Trissin [SEP] yeah contender's shell has perks for levi
Thawxtem [SEP] Exotic?
Trissin [SEP] yes its exotic
Thawxtem [SEP] Figures. Thanks anyway
Trissin [SEP] yep, np
Bobthedog [SEP] @Trissin If you still need a sixth i can help but no guarantee of how long i can stay for
Sabre [SEP] Shit sorry guys got caught up and didn't see these
Masrim [SEP] anyone know what this expired ramen coupon is for?
Trissin [SEP] pretty sure it's just there for the lore
Trissin [SEP] it's a message from cayde
Trissin [SEP] i think bungie confirmed that there is no second part of the quest, it's just to inspect and read about cayde
Masrim [SEP] hmm weird, mine just says  good for a free gyoso or something
Masrim [SEP] oh i have to hit e to read more
Arixama [SEP] Yup. People are speculating all kinds of things, but bungie has said its just a gift from cayde.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Gonna be close on my Titan for solstice armor. Need super kills, Nightfall, Crucible wins, 2 more strikes, Void melee kills, Adventures, and then all the missions.
Oathbreaker [SEP] It'll be super fucking close lol.
Trissin [SEP] you can make it!
Trissin [SEP] for void melee kills, super kills count btw so I can just run around shield bashing everything with doom fang pauldrons
Trissin [SEP] (also you can grab a void sword and melee things with it once it's out of ammo)
Arixama [SEP] @here would anyone be interested in running heroic stikes and a high score nightfall later on today so I can finish up my masterworks?
Thawxtem [SEP] I would love to help with Heroic strikes tonight, I need them for blue solstice armor. I get off of work at 9:00 CST
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm gonna do the Whisper shadow thrall room for my super kills. Strikes are done.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Will do the whisper room for the void melees as well
Oathbreaker [SEP] Then it's adventures, NF, crucible, and missions.
Oathbreaker [SEP] The adventures and missions are gonna be okay, the NF will be alright, it's crucible that I'm worried about (Ari can attest to the last time I had to do PvP and how defeated I sounded)
Aberration [SEP] I have my Hunter left for armor...stuck on crucible supers. So mad about it and I don't even know if I want to do it
Aberration [SEP] It's antifun for me
Arixama [SEP] After about 5 hours, oath still hadn't managed 5 wins in mayhem. Awful luck.
Aberration [SEP] Wood
Aberration [SEP] Woof*
Thawxtem [SEP] I was able to finish that two days ago without mayhem. It was a pain, but it’s possible
Aberration [SEP] I usually don't have problems with wins it's really just super kills. Maybe I'll try golden gun
Thawxtem [SEP] I used arcstrider
Thawxtem [SEP] What I have problems with is actually winning.
Aberration [SEP] Arc is OK but it seems that the folks I've been matching with are smart, stand their ground and unreasonably accurate
Aberration [SEP] Or maybe I'm just bad. That's a thing too haha
Arixama [SEP] Are you using your dodge?
Thawxtem [SEP] Someone here gave me the advice to use the set that makes you harder to kill when dodging and spam it. Got me close enough for at least one kill typically
Aberration [SEP] Yeah it just takes forever to get 30
Aberration [SEP] its a sad time
Oathbreaker [SEP] As I said: Ari knows my pain from my Hunter attempts. Titan is gonna be interesting as well.
Masrim [SEP] Titan was easy compared to Hunter. Way easier
Arixama [SEP] the worst part about hunter is you hav eto do the 20 challenges. titan and warlock its just defeat enemies
Thawxtem [SEP] Is it worth it to try and get Legendary Solstice gear on a Titan I haven't created yet?
Thawxtem [SEP] Also, Heric strikes anyone?
Thawxtem [SEP] *heroic
Arixama [SEP] the biggest question is if you want the ship
Oathbreaker [SEP] Remember you have to complete the story to get the tower.
Thawxtem [SEP] but getting through the story...
Oathbreaker [SEP] Until you hit the tower you won't get the green armor.
Thawxtem [SEP] Ya, and that's my main stopper
Aberration [SEP] Max vanguard rank and get ship, or save tokens for Forsaken?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Personal opinion: Max Vanguard. Gets you the ship and a MoT
Aberration [SEP] PSA: Clean out your postmaster today
Arixama [SEP] Update is available for download and it's a doozy.
Arixama [SEP] 36 gigs or so.
Masrim [SEP] 36!! Can you go by my house and get it started for me
Arixama [SEP] Only if there's pizza waiting for me
Masrim [SEP] There should be dominoes there
Sabre [SEP] New nighthawk with random perks -- Bow Targeting, Fusion Rifle Targeting, Hands on -- Rocket Launcher Reserves, Sword Reserves
Aberration [SEP] Sweet jeebus that IS a big update
Trissin [SEP] omg its almost like d1 again
RonInDune [SEP] The new gun system is .. confusing
Oathbreaker [SEP] @RonInDune takes a bit to get used to. I'm sure there's a way to differentiate between primaries and secondaries. I thought I saw a post on Reddit saying that if a gun is angled to the left then it's a secondary, while to the right is primary. I could be wrong though
Arixama [SEP] That's accurate for kinetic vs energy, but not for ammo type.
Arixama [SEP] It'll probably be a lot easier once forsaken drops and we have a whole campaign of getting new weapons to actually get used to the new system.
Aberration [SEP] I'm looking forward to more diversity in loadouts. I feel as if I've been very stagnant in what I use
Aberration [SEP] Super busy week I haven't even logged in since the patch
Trissin [SEP] I havent even downloaded the patch yet RIP
Oathbreaker [SEP] RIP your internet bill. 36GB dude
Arixama [SEP] I just t re-downloaded the whole game on Ps4, 35gb base, 45gb patch.
RonInDune [SEP] Back in my day games only took 4 floppies to install and any game above 3 MB contains too much fluff.
RonInDune [SEP] Let's petition Bungie to reduce game size by 99%, they've got to listen to the customers.
Arixama [SEP] Do that and destiny just becomes a clicker.
Masrim [SEP] I don't know. I remember lands of lore or something that was like 44 discs
Masrim [SEP] so I download 36gb, then I have to download another 7gb?
Masrim [SEP] its been sitting on initializing for 30 minutes, sigh
Trissin [SEP] i just downloaded the patch today
Trissin [SEP] I had the exact same problem
Trissin [SEP] i was stuck on initializing forever
Trissin [SEP] i think you have to fix it manually @Masrim , it will just say initializing forever
Trissin [SEP] and it's a fairly lengthy process
Trissin [SEP] if you are still stuck on initializing just send me a quick msg and ill try to help you out
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone want to jump into a private match real quick? Want to test the OHK range of the new shotgun I got.
Masrim [SEP] It literally was ready to play just as I got to to go to bed
Masrim [SEP] I'm taking it as a sign to not play yet
Arixama [SEP] Whose going to be playing gambit tomorrow?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Definitely me. Can't wait to try it, looks super cool.
Masrim [SEP] SO.. big update = even less to do?
Arixama [SEP] Big update = get used to new weapons system so you don't have to learn it when the big new stuff to do goes well in.
Arixama [SEP] Also the only things gone are trials, heroic strikes and scoring on prestige nightfalls I think
Masrim [SEP] perfect paradox/ auto or scout/ whisper
Masrim [SEP] they really got rid of the variation
Masrim [SEP] PP can be replaced weith ikelos sg if you have it
RonInDune [SEP] I've heard that there's a auto leveler?
RonInDune [SEP] I have only two characters at lvl 30, one char at almost max light
Masrim [SEP] i got a piece of new armor with bow/pulse stabilizer and arc protection
Arixama [SEP] Not yet. After forsaken there will be a level 30 boost that i believe skips the main campaign. Most likely will also give some sort of armor at 345 if I had to guess.
Arixama [SEP] It's also impossible to judge what they did or didn't do as far as gun variation right now.
Trissin [SEP] I think the boost is the same as the spark of light from D1 where it just instantly levels you up
Trissin [SEP] i cant recall for sure but i think you got a set of basic and somewhat under-levelled armor as well
RonInDune [SEP] That's cool. I don't think I would grind my third character to max level fully otherwise.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Currently working on that myself. Trying to get my Warlock through main campaign and to 30.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Who's up for some Gambit?
Trissin [SEP] it's out today?!?!?
Trissin [SEP] is today that trial thing
Oathbreaker [SEP] 24 Hour Trial
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone's up for it, just @ me and I'll party up.
Trissin [SEP] I'm a bit busy today but I'll see if I have some time to hop on and play some gambit
Trissin [SEP] tell me how it goes!
Oathbreaker [SEP] Will do!
Oathbreaker [SEP] It's so fucking fun.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Like 10/10 fun.
Trissin [SEP] !!!!!!!
Trissin [SEP] i have to go out in 10 minutes but ill make time for 1 match haha
Oathbreaker [SEP] Grouped up with some randoms and we smashed our first team
Oathbreaker [SEP] So much fun
Trissin [SEP] nice!!!
Arixama [SEP] Where is it on the director?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Between strikes and crucible
Trissin [SEP] i think its just under strikes and crucible, in its own little thing
Trissin [SEP] yeah
Arixama [SEP] I'm going to guess the drifter isn't in the tower yet?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Nope
Oathbreaker [SEP] Not that I'm aware of
Arixama [SEP] There's no rewards, right?
Trissin [SEP] oh my god that is so much fun i want to play this forever
Trissin [SEP] i matchmade with some randoms and wrecked the first team, it felt awesome
Oathbreaker [SEP] This is too much fucking fun
Oathbreaker [SEP] Waaaay too much fun
Aberration [SEP] Wait...good pvp?
Aberration [SEP] what is this
Arixama [SEP] pvp
Aberration [SEP] That's probably why haha
Arixama [SEP] I can't wait to try it honestly.
Oathbreaker [SEP] I mean I hate PvP with a passion in D2, but Gambit is just too much fun. You have those crazy moments where you take down someone during an invade who's looking to bank 15 motes, total team wipe, or both teams doing this crazy damage race through the Primeval's health bar. I love it.
Oathbreaker [SEP] It also gives me incentives to get better at PvP, so I can become a much more effective Invader and not just be a defender.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Additionally, it's a fast paced and frantic mode that it's chaos in the best of ways.
storyteller [SEP] anyone interested in helping me get the wotw tonight?
Trissin [SEP] hey @storyteller sorry I was busy today! Im not 100% sure of my schedule tomorrow but if we are both on at some point I would be more than happy to help
storyteller [SEP] @Trissin Thanks! Tomorrow I won't be able to play at all, I have some family plans. I'll be back Monday though
Aberration [SEP] I can probably lend a hand on Monday as well, will be on and off all day
Aberration [SEP] also - LFG Nightfall need to run it on 2 chars
Masrim [SEP] I can hope on for a quick NF
RonInDune [SEP] So if anyone wants to go for anything, I'm down!
Aberration [SEP] Just got back. If NF is a thing I still need it @Masrim im @RonInDune
RonInDune [SEP] Sure I'll join in
RonInDune [SEP] SO turns out the nightfall doesn;t unlock if you don't log out and back in in somce cases. Interesting.
Arixama [SEP] Anybody want to do one last  raid later before forsaken drops tomorrow?
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah!
Arixama [SEP] Looking for about 6 half hours from now, but anytime after that I can do too.
RonInDune [SEP] Yup, that's good enough for me as well.
Arixama [SEP] @here anyone else up for a raid later today?
Oathbreaker [SEP] What raid are we gonna bully?
Arixama [SEP] Anything works for me.
RonInDune [SEP] Eater was the easiest for me. Though prestige Levi was pretty fun too.
RonInDune [SEP] Is @Trissin  available?
Arixama [SEP] I think it just depends on how much time people want to put in.
Trissin [SEP] hey! i'd love to do a raid today, although I have a few things to do at 10pm ET (7pm PT)
not entirely sure how long it will last, but I should be back on around 11 ET
Trissin [SEP] I am free anytime before that 👍
Arixama [SEP] Sounds like we've got four? @RonInDune @Trissin @Oathbreaker
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm a maybe. Got college orientation tomorrow so I do need to get things ready for Wednesday classes. We get a group, I'll definitely try to join for a while.
Sabre [SEP] depending on the time, Id be in as well
Trissin [SEP] I might be a bit iffy on the time as well, I've got to head out for a bit right now and I am not too sure when I will be back. Don't hesitate to replace or start without me! (sorry in advance !)
Trissin [SEP] @PC How is everybody enjoying forsaken?????
Peronix [SEP] Only played a bit but enjoy it a lot!  And bows are amazing\
Sabre [SEP] its been a lot of fun so far
Sabre [SEP] just been doing story with @zetaa
Sabre [SEP] we're about to jump into Gambit
Trissin [SEP] good!! i just started as well
Trissin [SEP] and ive been having a ton of fun
Trissin [SEP] its really good
Masrim [SEP] ugh another update?
Masrim [SEP] guess I don't play tonight lol
Oathbreaker [SEP] Super super fun for me. Damn college having to start the same day though hahaha.
RonInDune [SEP] I love the new area!
AY AY RON [SEP] the bow is super bad ass
Thawxtem [SEP] Forsaken story finished! Max level! Good day!
Aberration [SEP] Yasssss to everything
Masrim [SEP] I hate you all for having time to play
Trissin [SEP] I was busy yesterday and barely played ahhh
Arixama [SEP] The bow feels real nice. At least the one I got.
Arixama [SEP] It's got timed payload
Trissin [SEP] !loadout
Trissin [SEP] This one? The one from Petra?
Arixama [SEP] Yup
Trissin [SEP] no turning back
Trissin [SEP] I want to play so bad
Trissin [SEP] I'm lucky I only have a few classes this morning, I'll have the afternoon to play :))
Arixama [SEP] Do we know the recommended light for the raid?
Trissin [SEP] i dont think it's been announced yet
Trissin [SEP] although I really want to get a team together and try it blind
Trissin [SEP] would you guys be interested in that?
Trissin [SEP] we can put it off a little bit, since I imagine the light requirement will probably be pretty high
Trissin [SEP] and we will need some time to reach it
Trissin [SEP] let's do it blind!
Helatia [SEP] Thawxtem and I are 500 already so we are down
Helatia [SEP] Gimmie, our new guy and one of my friends, isnt far behind that either
Helatia [SEP] !loadout
Trissin [SEP] oh nooooooooooo memory of cayde
Trissin [SEP] :c
Trissin [SEP] but anyway that's awesome helatia, if we have the people at high enough light then we should definitely give it a try
Arixama [SEP] I'm 501 and working on getting higher, but I'd definitely be down.
Helatia [SEP] Same. Working on the legendary engrams and powerful ones to up that light
Helatia [SEP] @PC If anyone wants help, or just an extra hand, with the story tonight feel free to message me.
Helatia [SEP] I'll be on after 9 central
RonInDune [SEP] WHen does the raid drop?
Arixama [SEP] The 14th
RonInDune [SEP] Oh I have the weekend to max out power, that's good
Arixama [SEP] Honestly If I had to guess, recommended power will probably be 570 or so
Arixama [SEP] Oh crap I'm out of town when the raid drops
Thawxtem [SEP] I'd love to try the new raid, but I've only ever completed Leviathan once, and I'm curious if it would be a whole lot easier at 500. I'd love to try it a few more times, at least once, before the new one comes out if anyone would like to help.
Trissin [SEP] yeah, we should take you through EOW, Spire, and the prestige raids
Thawxtem [SEP] could probably double as training to lvl 50
Arixama [SEP] Id be down to do any and all. I super want to test out bows and stuff
Trissin [SEP] ohhhhhhhhh that's going to be a lot of fun I imagine
Arixama [SEP] I'll be interested to see them on gauntlet, to see if they stick around on the buttons.
Arixama [SEP] I doubt it though.
Thawxtem [SEP] When would you be available? I’m off the rest of today, tomorrow, and Saturday
Arixama [SEP] I'm available tonight after like 6ish. Then Thursday and Friday.
Helatia [SEP] Gimmie will be on after 7ish and I will be on after 9ish
Arixama [SEP] What do we want to run if we do?
Thawxtem [SEP] As I said, I’ve only done it once, so I’m not sure about the 3rd yet
Arixama [SEP] So either leviathan or eow would probably be good.
Arixama [SEP] And it sounds like we've got 4 depending on times.
Trissin [SEP] I think EOW sounds great, shouldn't take too long either
Trissin [SEP] we'll see who's available at around 7pm ET (6 CT)
Thawxtem [SEP] Trissin, Arixama, Helatia, Thawxtem, and two more, yes?
Trissin [SEP] Helatia said Gimmie will be available... but I don't think i've played with him/her before
Thawxtem [SEP] I was with him doing forsaken story last night
Thawxtem [SEP] Just joined guild, or tried to
RonInDune [SEP] I'm available THrusday/Firday evening!
Arixama [SEP] You got your times wrong @Trissin
Arixama [SEP] 6 CT is 7 ET
Trissin [SEP] crap
Trissin [SEP] my bad
Trissin [SEP] sorry haha
RonInDune [SEP] holy carp the adventures in the expansion are awesome!
Thawxtem [SEP] May be too early for Helatia. He said around 9 CST
Thawxtem [SEP] Curious to see if everyone from the raid talk is playing right now
Trissin [SEP] Anybody want to run the nightfall?
Trissin [SEP] Just for completion, not a score run
RonInDune [SEP] What's the power requirement?
Arixama [SEP] im in
Trissin [SEP] Recommended 540 but I'm gonna be going in around 510
Trissin [SEP] lol
RonInDune [SEP] Welp 1'm 502
Arixama [SEP] if i could get help finishing up this heroic adventure, that'd be swell
Trissin [SEP] yeah absolutely ill join in
RonInDune [SEP] Good luck,, brave warriors
Trissin [SEP] also ron 502 is fine, things will just hurt a lot
Trissin [SEP] lol
RonInDune [SEP] Hey guys sorry for rushing out at hte end, my roommate came in and wanted to talk
RonInDune [SEP] Tanks for a great nightfall though!
Trissin [SEP] No worries at all, it's all good 👍
Trissin [SEP] That was quite the nightfall
Trissin [SEP] I had fun tho
AY AY RON [SEP] apparently this is how levelling your light level works now: https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e2l75/the_power_leveling_system_has_been_changed/
Arixama [SEP] Definitely seems like it. I'm only getting a few power boosts now from powerful engrams. I don't remember what my clan xp engram dropped at last night, but I think it was 520 something
Trissin [SEP] ohh, I didn't know about this, thank you!
Arixama [SEP] I'm at 519 currently
Trissin [SEP] im at 511
RonInDune [SEP] SO getting to 600 will be a nightmare
Trissin [SEP] also, i need to do some gambit + crucible + EP with clanmates so if anybody else needs that, hmu
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah I'm down later tonight
Arixama [SEP] Do we know that the ep drop is this week?
Trissin [SEP] im not sure, sorry]
Arixama [SEP] Max gambit rank is 15000 points.
Arixama [SEP] Also if we can get 4 for gambit later we should try to go for the secret triumph
Trissin [SEP] the 60 mega-drop thing?
Trissin [SEP] its an emblem right?
Arixama [SEP] Yup.
Arixama [SEP] This week ep drop is sniper, next week is all
Trissin [SEP] ah ok
Trissin [SEP] i dont think we have to finish it, just clear 3 waves
Arixama [SEP] If we've got the people we should finish it though. I know I don't have any of the weapons.
Trissin [SEP] yeah i guess we may as well just do it haha
Trissin [SEP] remember the weapons arent guaranteed drop though, it's rng
Arixama [SEP] I didn't realize that they drop from the boss and not the locked chest.
Trissin [SEP] yeah, they come from the boss
Trissin [SEP] it's quite common to try and 'farm' the boss by failing level 7 intentionally
Arixama [SEP] Like killing it at the last possible second right? So it dies and drops loot but technically you've failed
RonInDune [SEP] I need to do the 10 EP level clears for a quest, so that'd be excellent
Arixama [SEP] Nascent dawn?
RonInDune [SEP] yup yup
RonInDune [SEP] IS geomag stabilizers a forsaken exotic?
Arixama [SEP] I don't recognize the name so probably.
Arixama [SEP] Does it have the forsaken emblem in the corner?
RonInDune [SEP] Cool, so losing 5 crucible matches in a row was worth something
RonInDune [SEP] Oh yeah it does now that I check
Arixama [SEP] Silver linings!
Trissin [SEP] what's geomag stabilizers
Trissin [SEP] whaat
Trissin [SEP] yes apparently its a new set of warlock boots
Arixama [SEP] Yeah give us those perk details!
RonInDune [SEP] oh no woops
RonInDune [SEP] Geomag exotic
Arixama [SEP] OH MY GOD GIMME
RonInDune [SEP] Start losing in the crucible
Arixama [SEP] I want chromatic fire really though.
Arixama [SEP] Adds elemental explosions to precision kills I believe.
Arixama [SEP] And it stacks with ace
Trissin [SEP] wait wut
Trissin [SEP] hows that gonna work
Trissin [SEP] double explosions??
Trissin [SEP] haha
Arixama [SEP] Triple actually.
Trissin [SEP] triple??
Trissin [SEP] ._.
Arixama [SEP] Firefly and chromatic fire has an immediate and a timed
Arixama [SEP] https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e288e/ace_of_spades_chromatic_fire_fatebringer_on/?utm_source=reddit-android
Trissin [SEP] wait what chromatic fire has _two_ explosions_???
Arixama [SEP] Apparently.
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Arixama [SEP] I think bungie just wanted explosions for everything.
Trissin [SEP] hahaha
Arixama [SEP] Explosive arrows, dragonfly and firefly, chromatic fire, two tailed fox.
Arixama [SEP] Everything
Trissin [SEP] yep, yeah
Trissin [SEP] lots of explosions haha
Trissin [SEP] _what if you could roll dragonfly on a bow_
Arixama [SEP] I have it on subtle calamity.
Trissin [SEP] wait what
Trissin [SEP] serious
Arixama [SEP] Yeah.
Trissin [SEP] _oh hey banshee, how's it going, i've got these 6000 gunsmith materials here_
Arixama [SEP] Haha
Arixama [SEP] I was using it during the nightfall and heroic adventure.
Trissin [SEP] I have to get me one of those
Trissin [SEP] it sounds amazing
Arixama [SEP] It's real good.
Arixama [SEP] Better than no turning back.
Trissin [SEP] honestly I havent noticed much of a difference between the two bows
Arixama [SEP] With dragonfly it's just good cause it does the aoe on precision
Arixama [SEP] Plus it let's me use perfect paradox when I want to
Trissin [SEP] yeah, it's a good balance of different ranges and DPS
RonInDune [SEP] Guys what's the best way to grind out advanced paradox amplifiers?
Arixama [SEP] Crucible or strikes
Arixama [SEP] Try and double up on something else you need to do
RonInDune [SEP] OK yeah that sounds easier then the heroic story missions I've been doing
Arixama [SEP] Especially if you just hop into a normal strike on the map. Xol is a pretty easy one. If you need taken kills too, run Lake of shadows on earth.
Trissin [SEP] Depending on the story mission, I don't think they are too bad
Trissin [SEP] I ran the Warmind mission on Earth 3x for the weekly milestone pretty fast
Trissin [SEP] But definitely multitask if you can, go for something that will net multiple objectives at once
Trissin [SEP] like ari suggested
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah that's a good plan. I dislike the mercure heroics anyway
Arixama [SEP] It's heroic adventures right?
RonInDune [SEP] yup
Arixama [SEP] I'm which were you running?
RonInDune [SEP] I was doing all 3 available on mercury again and again
Arixama [SEP] The runner is the easiest one by far.
RonInDune [SEP] It's just the run up through the infinite forest that's boring
Arixama [SEP] Yeah it's awful.
Arixama [SEP] What time are we looking at for EP @Trissin
Trissin [SEP] ou, I don't know
Trissin [SEP] let me check the boss this week
Arixama [SEP] The one you shoot in the back
Trissin [SEP] ohh the ogre right?
Arixama [SEP] Yup
Trissin [SEP] alright that one isn't too bad, i think we can do it with at least 5
Trissin [SEP] @PC is anybody interested in doing some escalation protocol today?
AY AY RON [SEP] im down for EP
RonInDune [SEP] I would prefer later in the evening, but otherwise I'm available as well
Arixama [SEP] I can get on  whenever.
Trissin [SEP] awesome, that's 4 people
Trissin [SEP] who knows, maybe some randoms will join us along the way
Trissin [SEP] when are you free @AY AY RON and @RonInDune
RonInDune [SEP] How many do we need? I've had a devil of time doing it with 3 people
RonInDune [SEP] I'm down post 8 PM Central
AY AY RON [SEP] anytime after 8pm est
Trissin [SEP] okay so it sounds like around 9pm EST which is 8pm CT
Trissin [SEP] @PC EP?
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I'll need around 15 more minutes unfortunately
Trissin [SEP] okay no worries, just let us know'
Arixama [SEP] im in gameso just shoot me a whisper when we're ready
Arixama [SEP] unless we want to try and start finding an instance
AY AY RON [SEP] im ready whenever as well
Trissin [SEP] :S
Trissin [SEP] I am in voice for EP, everybody welcome! @PC
Peronix [SEP] Got any more room for EP?
Thawxtem [SEP] Is anyone free Tuesday? I’m at the point of begging to do a Leviathan eow and/or sos for the first time. I’ve only been able to be in the first one once and would love more of the Leviathan drops before nobody at all wants to do it anymore.
Trissin [SEP] omg everybody left, so sorry thawxtem
Arixama [SEP] i'll be around tuesday
Trissin [SEP] I think I should be free on tuesday night, id love to do all the raids with u @Thawxtem
Trissin [SEP] yeah
RonInDune [SEP] Tuesday night's good for me too!
Arixama [SEP] i want to run at least lev and eow before the new raid comes out
Trissin [SEP] okay, yeah, lets do it
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah
Arixama [SEP] what time?
Thawxtem [SEP] How about 8 CST?
Peronix [SEP] Im in as well
Thawxtem [SEP] That’s 5. 1 more.
TheCnC [SEP] Let me see if I'm raiding in wow first.  If I'm not I should be able to do Lev and SoS as well
Arixama [SEP] When will you know?
TheCnC [SEP] by the end of the day.  It's going to depend on the warfront today if I can get my drop from there or not.
Arixama [SEP] Oh God there's another hidden gambit triumph called protect the runner. Requires 100 motes deposited by a single person without losing one.
Thawxtem [SEP] Is it over multiple games? I thought 75 summoned the primeval
Arixama [SEP] Single game. There's at least 2 rounds per match.
Arixama [SEP] And you have to win.
Arixama [SEP] https://m.imgur.com/a/znLyXJt
Masrim [SEP] I can get rid of all my old armor right?  no need for it anymore?
Arixama [SEP] Yeah, unless you like it.
Sabre [SEP] anyone up for Gambit? we need 1 more. trying to get the secret triumphs
TheCnC [SEP] I'm good for tuesday
Arixama [SEP] So we've got @Thawxtem , @TheCnC , @Arixama , @Peronix, @Trissin and @RonInDune?
Thawxtem [SEP] Need to make sure we have a time; no one responded when I suggested my time
Arixama [SEP] @RonInDune @Peronix @Trissin @TheCnC what time works for everybody?
RonInDune [SEP] Anytime after 8 CST.
I can stretch to 7:30 CST in a pinch.
Thawxtem [SEP] I would still prefer around 8 CST like I said, mainly to make sure my day is done, dinner is out of the way, and I won't have any distractions
TheCnC [SEP] I'm good whenever
Peronix [SEP] I'm down for 8 CST or later
RonInDune [SEP] OK why are half the places in the dreaming city literally off the map? I'm in the Spine of Keres and the map isn't showing me at all...
RonInDune [SEP] Also, the COnfluence is super spooky
Thawxtem [SEP] I explored there and made a map last night. I see it as a fast travel across the dreaming city with all the final portal destinations. Only one was dangerous because it dropped you in the middle of a taken swarm
RonInDune [SEP] Oh that makes sense.
Thawxtem [SEP] Are you there now? I'm fixing to get on and wouldn't mind a buddy in the dreaming city
RonInDune [SEP] Nah I just left, I did the Blind Well Tier 3 a bunch of times with randoms and I'm all destinied out for now. 

It's such a cool place, just wish I was higher level.
Thawxtem [SEP] bummer. Nobody's around whenever I visit. I've visited several times
RonInDune [SEP] Aw dang. We should get the clan group together for the event. It needs a lot of people to be successful.
Thawxtem [SEP] It would be amazing if we had multiple clan fireteams in the same dreaming city server
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah the clan features are severely lacking. Takes forever to get a group for Escalation Protocol as well
Thawxtem [SEP] Never actually done EP before. I can't start it for some reason even after completing the Warmind story
Arixama [SEP] if you go in slowly, the game has time to match you with other people
Thawxtem [SEP] go in slowly?
Arixama [SEP] yeah, like crouch walk
Thawxtem [SEP] ...sorry, but I'm lost on how that fits in. Unless I'm thinking of something else
Thawxtem [SEP] EP is Mars event activated by squares, yes?
Arixama [SEP] i mean fir blind well
Thawxtem [SEP] To anyone playing right now: I would love some help with getting through the Ascendant Challenge quest in dreaming city. All you need is Tincture of Queensfoil and probably a shotgun.
Trissin [SEP] oh I need to do that as well
Trissin [SEP] do u think we could 2 man it?
Trissin [SEP] cuz im pretty sure if u die you cant get back in
Thawxtem [SEP] Enemies don’t shoot at you, you just need to keep running.
Trissin [SEP] yeah but those big knight do a **lot** of damage
Arixama [SEP] once i finish this gambit match i can join you guys
Thawxtem [SEP] Jump in the trees and they can’t get you
Trissin [SEP] https://www.tenor.co/TMql.gif
Arixama [SEP] @Trissin you going to hop on?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah, a trick for getting more people in your instance of Blind Well is to slow down going into the transition zone.
Oathbreaker [SEP] It's a trick that's been around since The Taken King with the Court of Oryx, and was also used in Rise of Iron with Archon's Forge. Basically, what happens is if you move too quickly through the transition zone (The hallway leading to The Blind Well in this case, just before you reach the new zone and the name of the zone comes up), the game will not have enough time to matchmake you into a zone with other players.
Oathbreaker [SEP] If you slow down, by either walking slowly, crouch walking, or moving through slowly on your sparrow, you'll give the game more time to matchmake and will be more likely to group up with others. It's not 100% effective, but it's definitely a way to improve your matchmaking ability.
Trissin [SEP] lol Archon's Forge
Trissin [SEP] sorry somehow I missed that notification last night @Arixama , but I'm free to do ascendent challenge today
@Thawxtem
Arixama [SEP] I ran him through it last night, but I can help help you through it.
Trissin [SEP] Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome, ty
Arixama [SEP] im good whenever
Trissin [SEP] 👍
Trissin [SEP] im online @Arixama
Trissin [SEP] been trying to solo it for the last 15 minutes
Arixama [SEP] Had to run out for food quick. Will hop on asap
Arixama [SEP] What's your loadout?
Trissin [SEP] actually i might have it here
Trissin [SEP] give me a min
Trissin [SEP] yep, i got it
Trissin [SEP] im okay now haha
Trissin [SEP] thank u tho!
Arixama [SEP] Yeah it's not awful.
Trissin [SEP] i was trying to run around and shotgun everything, problems occured when I ran out of ammo
Trissin [SEP] and if you die then the whole room gets reset
Trissin [SEP] eventually i figured out you can just camp on a tree and nothing can hit you....
Arixama [SEP] I ran a shotgun, pulse and whisper. If I ran out of shotgun ammo I killed some shadow thrall to get ammo back. Once I popped all the blights I camped on a tree and took out the crystals with whisper
Trissin [SEP] i ran a few tries in which I didnt camp on any trees, I just ran around with 2 shotguns and a grenade launcher
Trissin [SEP] when i ran out of ammo i had to melee some thrall without getting one-shot by the knights
Trissin [SEP] I almost had it one or two times
Trissin [SEP] was not fun.
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] The first time I actually got the chest to spawn it glitched and when I ran up to grab the chest, Knights spawned and murdered me about halfway through the collect loot wheel.
Arixama [SEP] And then I was locked out.
Trissin [SEP] THE SAME THING ALMOST HAPPENED TO ME
Trissin [SEP] I was like 3ft from the chest and everything spawned again
Trissin [SEP] i panicked, opened the chest and got the fuck outta there
Arixama [SEP] I just gave up for the night and had oath help me with it later.
Thawxtem [SEP] I don’t see why you wasted Whisper ammo, the crystals were a one-shot with a bow
Thawxtem [SEP] Save it for knights or a backup shotgun I say
Arixama [SEP] I had two shotguns the first time 🤣
Arixama [SEP] Gave me a sniper I could sit in a tree with that I was used to.
Trissin [SEP] Since we've got so many people online... does anybody want to do Eater of Worlds @PC ?
TheCnC [SEP] I can in just a bit
Peronix [SEP] I’m down
Peronix [SEP] Eyyy
Arixama [SEP] How soon we looking to start?
Trissin [SEP] as soon as we can
Trissin [SEP] as soon as we  get 6 people lol
Trissin [SEP] sabre and zeta said they can join as well
TheCnC [SEP] Ok coming on now
Arixama [SEP] I am on my way home, so if you don't get anyone before I get home, I'll join.
Trissin [SEP] i think thawxtem is going to join
TheCnC [SEP] ari if you would prefer to go that's fine.  I was just saying I was available to fill if needed
Thawxtem [SEP] I’m in
Thawxtem [SEP] Is Trissin leader?
Trissin [SEP] Sure, you can join up on me now
Thawxtem [SEP] Need to switch characters
Trissin [SEP] no worries
Arixama [SEP] @TheCnC you done eater of world's ever?
TheCnC [SEP] nope but it's ok if you want in
Arixama [SEP] Nah you do it. You need the experience.
TheCnC [SEP] ok lol
Arixama [SEP] if you guys need someone, just hit me up. im in for the night.
Arixama [SEP] @Trissin @Thawxtem @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune we still doing raids today @ 8cst?
TheCnC [SEP] Yep
Peronix [SEP] Roger
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I'm down
Thawxtem [SEP] Yes
Trissin [SEP] I might be a bit late, sorry in advance
Trissin [SEP] oh wait, nevermind, i confused ct and et
Trissin [SEP] I'll be on
Thawxtem [SEP] @Trissin @Arixama @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune reminder: Raid in 50 minutes. I’ll be waiting in orbit at that time
RonInDune [SEP] Yup yup
Trissin [SEP] Which raid are we doing? Leviathan or spire or prestige or
Trissin [SEP] :p
RonInDune [SEP] We could do spire, I like the difficulty.
Trissin [SEP] alright, spire it is
Thawxtem [SEP] Yay! spire is the only one I haven’t done, so this will finish my trio!
Thawxtem [SEP] Who will be the fire team leader?
Trissin [SEP] I don't think it really matters all too much, as long as we are in the same fireteam
Trissin [SEP] forewarning however, spire can be a bit of a communication challenge
Thawxtem [SEP] How so?
Trissin [SEP] I would say that spire has one of the most mechanically challenging boss fights in all of destiny, including d1
Trissin [SEP] there are just so many mechanics, and lots of communication is required
Trissin [SEP] buffs, symbols, and locations that need to be called out
Thawxtem [SEP] So more skill in cooperation than power level?
Trissin [SEP] I guess it's hard to say what's _more_ and whats _less_, but you will definitely have to be paying attention to whats going on while dealing with lots of ads
Trissin [SEP] the issue before was that it was a high power level, but we shouldnt have that problem now
Trissin [SEP] anyway, I think you'll see what I mean when we get into the encounters
Arixama [SEP] it sounds way harder than it actually is
Thawxtem [SEP] I just hope it isn't a disappointment like EoW was
Trissin [SEP] wut
Thawxtem [SEP] EoW seemed a little too easy. Idk if it was power level, but I liked Leviathan better
Trissin [SEP] ah. well, EOW is a raid _lair_ , meaning its supposed to be a lot shorter
Trissin [SEP] and I agree with you on that it was a bit easy, but that was probably due to the fact we have whisper of the worm now
Trissin [SEP] whisper is just so overpowered...
Thawxtem [SEP] especially at 500...
Trissin [SEP] i don't think we would've had enough damage to take him down on that first run without whisper
Trissin [SEP] and also, for shooting argos' weak spots, 2 or 3 whisper shots does it
Trissin [SEP] it used to be everyone with coldheart or valakadyn or something just screaming SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT IT
Trissin [SEP] it was kind of stressful at first haha
Thawxtem [SEP] Let's go ahead and go to voice chat to take up less discord space
RonInDune [SEP] I remember you guys totally faked me out with the ending when I did it. Thought I was gonna die when I started getting pulled out.
Trissin [SEP] lool
Trissin [SEP] sorry ron!
Arixama [SEP] the actual encounters in eow are pretty easy, but the locations and everything else are what i really enjoyed about it
Trissin [SEP] ^
solar side is *pretty*
Trissin [SEP] arc side is a little more meh
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] Give me a second my internet literally just died.
Trissin [SEP] ~~lol ofc no worries~~ @Arixama

damn too bad for u we gon 5 man it now
RonInDune [SEP] Are we joining up on Trissin?
Trissin [SEP] Yep
Thawxtem [SEP] Raid chat, yes?
Trissin [SEP] @Thawxtem we can hear you
Trissin [SEP] you can't hear us? @Thawxtem
Trissin [SEP] Alright, I think it's time to start putting together a team to tackle Last Wish _blind_ !
RonInDune [SEP] I'm still way too low level sadly. I can't get over 515 somehow.
Thawxtem [SEP] My best stuff gets me to around 520
Trissin [SEP] Yeah, it's really hard to level after 500
Trissin [SEP] I am gonna go ahead and guess the power requirement will be 550
RonInDune [SEP] Oh wow, are you  at 550 or thereabouts already?
Trissin [SEP] nonono im not even close haha
Trissin [SEP] but I think we should gather a team and figure out a date depending on how fast we level
Trissin [SEP] currently, the nightfall is the best way of levelling up a character
Trissin [SEP] Also, if we are going to do it blind, we have to take _every precaution_ not to follow any updates on twitch, youtube, reddit, etc
Trissin [SEP] anyway, i just wanted to get an idea of who might be interested in doing it blind
Thawxtem [SEP] Everything I know is this: ?
Trissin [SEP] once we are ready of course
zetaa [SEP] i would love to be a part of it, im not sure exactly what power level ill be when it drops though. probably will be a bit over 520. willing to stay off the internet in preparation haha
Trissin [SEP] I think just 520+ should be good enough for the first few encounters at least, I don't expect us to finish it
Arixama [SEP] Unless you guys do it on Monday I won't be around.
Trissin [SEP] noo ari!
Trissin [SEP] we can push it back
Trissin [SEP] gives us more time to level anyway
Trissin [SEP] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Arixama [SEP] I'm out of town and away from internet access until late Sunday night.
RonInDune [SEP] I'm sure mobile data works fine for online gaming.
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] Unfortunately I don't have a wifi card for my pc 😭
Trissin [SEP] don't worry about it, we can push the date back a bit
Arixama [SEP] Plus I'd rather not drag my desktop across 2 states. 🤣
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] If you guys end up doing it without me, my only request is for screenshots.
Trissin [SEP] well we'll see how it goes - how many people are interested, raiding experience, power level, free time, etc
Arixama [SEP] That being said, if anyone wants to help me out with this week's ascendant challenge later today that'd be great.
Trissin [SEP] absolutely, let's do it together
Thawxtem [SEP] I'd love to!\
Trissin [SEP] while we're at this we can also do gambit, crucible, other clan stuff
Thawxtem [SEP] I actually need to kill 4 of the knights there for the better mod for the dreaming city gear
Trissin [SEP] maybe some escalation protocol as well
Arixama [SEP] Awesome. what time are you guys around?
Trissin [SEP] wait u need to kill them??
Trissin [SEP] I am actually free atm
Thawxtem [SEP] I can get on now
Arixama [SEP] I won't be home until around 630.st
Arixama [SEP] Cst
Trissin [SEP] so about an hour and 15
Arixama [SEP] Yeah
Trissin [SEP] I think I should be good then, but honestly I can't say for sure at this point
Thawxtem [SEP] @Trissin after giving an offering to the machine, you get a quest to kill 4 there and fix the curse half of the armor
Trissin [SEP] If thawxtem is on you should go ahead and do it with him
Trissin [SEP] oh I haven't turned in that bounty yet, im waiting to turn in 3 at once
Arixama [SEP] I'm leaving tomorrow morning, so I'm trying to get as much done as I can before I go.
Trissin [SEP] gotcha
Arixama [SEP] The quest you get from the oracle has different requirements.
Thawxtem [SEP] Ascendant challenge will be weekly #3 for me
Thawxtem [SEP] gotcha. well, that was my quest this time
Arixama [SEP] Yeah, the one I have requires a plague of the well killed while ascendant
Thawxtem [SEP] @Arixama I'm getting on now. If you care to do ascendant challenge, join me in general chat
Trissin [SEP] i thought he still needed like an hour
Trissin [SEP] until he's home
Thawxtem [SEP] oh, misread. sorry
Arixama [SEP] That's Ok, there was a lot being said in a short amount of time.
Arixama [SEP] alright im hopping on now
Trissin [SEP] i suppose ill get on too
Thawxtem [SEP] You guys ever see the small ball of light in the challenge? I got a daily quest to find it again, so please help me keep an eye out for it
Trissin [SEP] i dont know what you are talking about
Arixama [SEP] its the toland  balls
Thawxtem [SEP] ^
Oathbreaker [SEP] Just pulled a Borealis from Ikora's engram. So. So. SO. Fucking. Happy.
Peronix [SEP] Bungie is apparently offering a jacket to people who complete the raid before Tuesday.  So anyone feel like tying the raid  tomorrow night?
TheCnC [SEP] I would, but my Light level is garbage and I have to be up super early the next day
Trissin [SEP] oooooh
Trissin [SEP] we can see how many people we've got
TheCnC [SEP] I know Arixama is out of town
Trissin [SEP] yeah
TheCnC [SEP] If you guys get the jacket he'll be impressed, and miffed at the same time lol.
TheCnC [SEP] But good luck to you all!
Peronix [SEP] Well, if we ever get 6 people, I can do it at 8:30 CST.  Until then, I gotta get my guardian some gains
Trissin [SEP] Whoaaa, there are more rewards
Trissin [SEP] If you complete the raid in the first 24 hours you get an emblem as well
Trissin [SEP] and then the world's first team are all guaranteed the one thousand voices exotic weapon
Trissin [SEP] the laser with the delayed explosion
Trissin [SEP] It looks like you only need to be 520 to enter but it will be recommended 550
Trissin [SEP] im so freaking hypedddd
zetaa [SEP] im down to try to tackle it early. would love the jacket tbh haha
Trissin [SEP] IT'S OUTTT
zetaa [SEP] 2 more classes to go 😢
zetaa [SEP] ive muted like every D2 channel and am probably unsubbing from the subreddit until we do our run haha. im taking this too seriously
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'm doing a blind run tomorrow so I'm in like full NO ONE TELLS ME ANYTHING mode
TheCnC [SEP] Raid's out figure I might check out the light level requirement...sees it's 550...Nope not going to be able to touch that for a while lol
Oathbreaker [SEP] Is it 550? That's gonna be rough for me then jesus.
RonInDune [SEP] Are any of you 550?
TheCnC [SEP] It is 550
Oathbreaker [SEP] Nope
Oathbreaker [SEP] Very few people in the world are 550 and up
Arixama [SEP] I'm max 534.
RonInDune [SEP] So looks like all my time spending collecting lore instead of increasing light might not have been the best choice
zetaa [SEP] i feel that so much, i need those triumphs
Arixama [SEP] It's also like pretty rng heavy though. I've gotten pretty lucky getting the things I need to increase my light.
zetaa [SEP] yeah absolutely. definitely need to finish my engram challenges still, have been slacking on nightfall
Arixama [SEP] Nightfall is rough right now.
Arixama [SEP] I can't even imagine trying to go for a high score run.
Oathbreaker [SEP] NF is super rough right now but I still need to do it for something at the very least.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Gotta try to edge out those 3 LL hahaha
Arixama [SEP] Hopefully I'll have gambit, heroic story and crucible milestone to do when I get home.
zetaa [SEP] yeah definitely wouldn't be able to get that high score engram but it's possible to beat it (after bashing your head against a wall for too long)
Oathbreaker [SEP] I still have to do heroic story I think
Arixama [SEP] Yeah, Ron trissin and I did it last week.
Arixama [SEP] Supposedly they put in a hotfix to fix the bugged reset from Saturday. Can anyone confirm  that?
zetaa [SEP] yep. the challenges are now up
zetaa [SEP] was nice to see all the icons pop up on a thursday haha
Arixama [SEP] Phenomenal
Oathbreaker [SEP] Yeah it
Oathbreaker [SEP] It's fixed *
Oathbreaker [SEP] So I no longer am raiding tomorrow lmfao.
Oathbreaker [SEP] One guy in the group saw the first encounter
Oathbreaker [SEP] Like the LL, and just basically said, welp, more than half of us won't be able to do any damage
zetaa [SEP] what LL are you?
Oathbreaker [SEP] 527
Thawxtem [SEP] Who was in the group that wanted to do raid blind? when are we doing it? I'd like to get my hands on that jacket
Thawxtem [SEP] Okay, I'd just like to get into the raid asap, so whenever you get on and want to do raid, please @ me and join my fireteam. When we have 6, we'll go into new Raid
Peronix [SEP] I would love to go into the raid blind, but i won't be able to until tonight
Arixama [SEP] I'm not available until monday
Trissin [SEP] nightfall anybody? @PC
Trissin [SEP] i got kicked @Thawxtem @AY AY RON
Trissin [SEP] signing back in now
Peronix [SEP] Has any player beaten the raid yet?
Helatia [SEP] Nope
Helatia [SEP] @PC  Anybody want to do fresh Leviathian? Need 1
Helatia [SEP] !triumphs
Helatia [SEP] !score
Thawxtem [SEP] !triumphs
RonInDune [SEP] Guys I tried the ascendant challenge and I just couldn't do it. Is 520 too low, or are the end knights just hard?
Trissin [SEP] I think those knights are just pretty strong lol
zetaa [SEP] yeah i cheesed it by repeatedly thundercrashing into the well of light at like 520
Trissin [SEP] lol, i think the other way is to just find a tree to camp in
Trissin [SEP] you are literally invincible as long as you are not on the ground'
Trissin [SEP] nothing can hurt u
RonInDune [SEP] Oh that's a good tip, I'll be trying that next. i just wish it didn't need the consumable every time.
Peronix [SEP] Anyone down to attempt The Last Wish tomorrow? Probably won't get too far but it seems like a good time
zetaa [SEP] if we wanted to get a group together im good past like 3pm CST
zetaa [SEP] will prob be only 533 or so
Trissin [SEP] @Arixama ?
Arixama [SEP] Ended up getting delayed and won't be home until sometime tomorrow, but if I'm not home too late definitely.
RonInDune [SEP] I haven't played enough and am still at 522, I could join in if I won't be a liability.
Trissin [SEP] we'll see if we can get through the first encounter
RonInDune [SEP] Let's do it then!
Arixama [SEP] what time are we looking at trying the raid?
Trissin [SEP] when will u be back??
Arixama [SEP] I am already back
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Arixama [SEP] Yup
Arixama [SEP] I can be ready whenever
RonInDune [SEP] I'll be in around 3 - 3:30 CST.
Trissin [SEP] I have classes until 8 ET (7 CT)
RonInDune [SEP] We can start then, that's good for me.
Trissin [SEP] who else is joining us? @Peronix @zetaa @Thawxtem @Oathbreaker interested?
Trissin [SEP] if there are too many people i will step out
Arixama [SEP] Good for me too.
Peronix [SEP] I’m down, but I won’t be able to get on until 8:30 CT cause work just called me in.
zetaa [SEP] 8:30 CST is about when id be all set as well, i have an hour long meeting at 7 that might run over a little
Oathbreaker [SEP] No can do. College is keeping me busy now. Gotta do some projects tonight
Arixama [SEP] @here we still attempting raid stuff tonight?
Peronix [SEP] If we got enough people. I don't know who's all ready
Trissin [SEP] @PC Last Wish ???
Helatia [SEP] Are we doing this?
TheCnC [SEP] I would give it my honest best try...but I'm only 507
Helatia [SEP] I'm 530
Trissin [SEP] I mayy not be able to join, actually, because i just found out i have some work to do
Trissin [SEP] oh.. I think cnc might be a bit low
Peronix [SEP] I think minimum is 520
Trissin [SEP] ^
Trissin [SEP] otherwise things will just be immune i think
Peronix [SEP] If we don't have enough people, we can put it on for another night if that works for everyone
TheCnC [SEP] I wasn't suggesting you actually take me.  Sorry if it seemed like I was saying otherwise
Arixama [SEP] so potentially we have @Peronix @Helatia and me, right?
Peronix [SEP] I think so
Trissin [SEP] @RonInDune @zetaa ?
Helatia [SEP] @Thawxtem
Thawxtem [SEP] Just got off work today. Already ate, is there still time to join?
Trissin [SEP] I don't believe it's started yet
Peronix [SEP] yep, we're still getting people together
Helatia [SEP] Gimmie is 528 and he is considering it
Trissin [SEP] @RonInDune @zetaa
Last Wish?
Helatia [SEP] 530 still shows skulls. We will get 1 shotted
Peronix [SEP] really? dang, im 521
RonInDune [SEP] Oops sorry yeah, I don't have enough time to do it now
RonInDune [SEP] I went into the raid today morning and I got one shot constantly at the first encounter. I was 522.
Helatia [SEP] You will need 540 minimum to get rid of skulls
Peronix [SEP] Y'all might gotta count me out then till I get a higher LL
Trissin [SEP] it's still fun to venture inside and figure out the mechanics
Peronix [SEP] That's true
zetaa [SEP] sorry for the delay, im here now if we wanna try it
Aberration [SEP] Anyone want to try for EP weapons this week? All 3 are dropping off this boss cycle.
Arixama [SEP] i got the shotgun last night.
Sabre [SEP] Anyone still raid blind?
Arixama [SEP] i am mostly. i went into it last night alone and took a look around, but thats it
AY AY RON [SEP] @PC anyone down for EP?
Aberration [SEP] I have a little time  for some EP in an hour or so...
Aberration [SEP] @AY AY RON  Still looking for EP?
AY AY RON [SEP] yea i am
AY AY RON [SEP] trying to find a pub team on LFG
AY AY RON [SEP] you down to join?
Aberration [SEP] I have about an hour or so

Aberration [SEP] at capacity
AY AY RON [SEP] k one sec
Aberration [SEP] im gonna go take care of a couple chores rq, brb
AY AY RON [SEP] lol this pub in our instance doesnt wana team up for whatever reason
AY AY RON [SEP] even tho he wants to do EP
Aberration [SEP] interesting
Aberration [SEP] I can try to load into your instance i suppose
Aberration [SEP] if only there was a better way
AY AY RON [SEP] yea we're in glacial drift
Aberration [SEP] im just reloading
Aberration [SEP] this is dumb. They really need the ability to join someone elses instance
AY AY RON [SEP] i got one
AY AY RON [SEP] can you send you btag?
AY AY RON [SEP] he'll add you
AY AY RON [SEP] and join on him
Aberration [SEP] yea
Aberration [SEP] absolutely

Aberration [SEP] Aberration#1246
Aberration [SEP] misunderstood sry

Aberration [SEP] on my way
Thawxtem [SEP] EP still going on? room for 1 more?
AY AY RON [SEP] yeah join abberation
AY AY RON [SEP] he has one more spot
Arixama [SEP] @here anyone up for a nightfall?
zetaa [SEP] yeah im down
Arixama [SEP] think we can do it with 2?
Trissin [SEP] ooh, whats the nightfall this week
Arixama [SEP] insight terminus, exodus crash and savathuns song
zetaa [SEP] im only 538 but i dont think thats too big of an issue. we can wait a lil bit for a third but im fine with trying 2
Trissin [SEP] only 538??
Trissin [SEP] 538 aint lowwww
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] im 547 now
Trissin [SEP] 😮
Trissin [SEP] whoa
zetaa [SEP] im low in comparison lmao
Arixama [SEP] also the ascendant challenge is pretty easy this week
Trissin [SEP] oh good
Trissin [SEP] i think im going to do the nightfall milestone last
Trissin [SEP] since it awards the highest gear
zetaa [SEP] im not sure what the order is supposed to be, ive heard that youre supposed to do dreaming city + nightfall first to get high gear and then the other activities will boost it by 1 or something? not sure
Arixama [SEP] i think dreaming city actually awards the highest gear
Arixama [SEP] cause its 560 or so
zetaa [SEP] your call though arixama we can wait or try it out. sabre might be on in a bit but hes mid 520 i think
zetaa [SEP] im on that destiny AND discord grind 😩
Arixama [SEP] we did it a couple weeks ago a a pretty low light and had a kind of rough time at it. but we did do it.
Trissin [SEP] oh wait, dreaming city is 560?
Arixama [SEP] some areas for sure.
zetaa [SEP] i figure if us two are at or above the light level we can do it but it wont hurt with the third
Trissin [SEP] i mean dreaming city can award 560+ gear??
Arixama [SEP] i got a bunch of 550+
Trissin [SEP] because im thinking about how bungie said challenges will award gear based on how underlevelled you are
Arixama [SEP] like an hour ago
zetaa [SEP] i think there are large powerful drops up to 560 and then it starts to diminish after that
zetaa [SEP] like how the other powerful drops for activities stop rewarding as high light level
Trissin [SEP] 🤔
zetaa [SEP] it's so confusing haha
Trissin [SEP] yeah
zetaa [SEP] there was a post about it on the subreddit a while back. that there are actually 3 tiers of powerful drops
Arixama [SEP] wanna give that nightfall a try?
Arixama [SEP] @zetaa
zetaa [SEP] yeah lemme finish this blind well run
zetaa [SEP] on the boss
zetaa [SEP] ok im ready
Arixama [SEP] what do we want to run?
zetaa [SEP] anything but exodus crash imo
zetaa [SEP] ill hop in the fireteam chat
Aberration [SEP] Anyone looking to grind EP today? I'm thinking I'll be around at 230est
Oathbreaker [SEP] Might be more available for things in the next few days. Gonna try to get ahead of the curve on most of my classes. Got work on the weekend but with some luck I should be able to actually play some Destiny over the next few days.
RonInDune [SEP] Oh dang when did they change the ace of spades quest? Looks like you make progress by any handcannon kills not just invaders
Trissin [SEP] yeah bungie changed it recently
Trissin [SEP] cuz people complain
Trissin [SEP] lol
Arixama [SEP] Thursday, I think. It was in the latest hotfix.
RonInDune [SEP] Praise bungo
Trissin [SEP] lool
Trissin [SEP] what's the ascendent challenge this week?
Arixama [SEP] Jumping puzzle with bombs and a boss at the top.
Trissin [SEP] oh okay
Trissin [SEP] u can solo it?
Arixama [SEP] I did. Mostly a lot of jumping around the arena at the top.
Trissin [SEP] ok maybe ill try it
Arixama [SEP] Its a taken phalanx.
RonInDune [SEP] Hey can anyone help me with this week's spider bounty? It's the fight in the EDZ
Helatia [SEP] @PC  I will take people to a chest in the new raid if anyone wants it
Trissin [SEP] oooooh
RonInDune [SEP] Oh heck yeah, but i'm still 526
Helatia [SEP] Hunters will need StompEs
Helatia [SEP] No combat nessicary
RonInDune [SEP] Can warlocks do it?
Helatia [SEP] If you can jump high enough lol
RonInDune [SEP] Well no harm in trying!
Helatia [SEP] Join in general
Helatia [SEP] It will take like 5 minutes
Helatia [SEP] already have the checkpoint
Helatia [SEP] @Trissin You want the chest?
RonInDune [SEP] THat was indeed pretty cool. Thanks man!
Helatia [SEP] @PC Doing another raid chest run for new raid. No combat needed. Anyone interested?
Arixama [SEP] I'd be up for it later.
Aberration [SEP] Already grabbed it on my lock, no one else has the awoken key yet ;_;
Helatia [SEP] This is the bridge chest after first encounter
Helatia [SEP] Secret chest
Helatia [SEP] no key required
Arixama [SEP] I think he means the dreaming city key.
Helatia [SEP] Oh, my bad
RonInDune [SEP] Hey anyone up for a nightfall?
AY AY RON [SEP] @PC nightfall anyone?
RonInDune [SEP] I'm down in like 3 minutes
AY AY RON [SEP] ok great, anyone else?
RonInDune [SEP] Yay I got my first forsaken weapon, 30 hours into the expansion.
Trissin [SEP] ooh, which weapon?
RonInDune [SEP] The two tailed fox!
Trissin [SEP] nice!!!! that's awesome
Trissin [SEP] I still dont' have any forsaken exotics 😢
RonInDune [SEP] I have the geomag stabilizers boots and this rocket launcher, both dropped from 500 power strikes
Trissin [SEP] powerful rewards? or just random strike drops
RonInDune [SEP] End of strike rewards both
Trissin [SEP] i should start doing strikes more often
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah they're surprisngly useful still
Arixama [SEP] Zavala is a stingy bitch.
Arixama [SEP] he's keeping his gloves from me.
RonInDune [SEP] Hey anyone up for trying the ascendant challenge with me? I keep getting knocked off by the end boss...
Arixama [SEP] i got you
Aberration [SEP] Anyone going to try for EP shotgun this week?
Aberration [SEP] I still want it ;_;
Trissin [SEP] I wish I could help, I've been so busy with classes this week
RonInDune [SEP] Me too...
Trissin [SEP] Haven't played at all since last reset
Aberration [SEP] No worries fam. If you get time this weekend and want to crush it I'll be around
RonInDune [SEP] Huh I didn't realize you don't have to do the raid to get the third subclass. You can just present an offering to the oracle and visit [REDACTED] at [REDACTED], which is probably the prettiest place in the DLC so far.
Trissin [SEP] yeah, i was surprised to learn that as well
Trissin [SEP] i agree it looks amazing
Trissin [SEP] there's also a hidden piece of lore there, did you pick it up?
Trissin [SEP] requires a bit of jumping
Arixama [SEP] Did not realize that the secondary perk on geo mags increase the length of chaos reach.
Arixama [SEP] They're even better than I thought
Trissin [SEP] rip i still havent gotten any forsaken exotics
Trissin [SEP] D:
Arixama [SEP] I honestly don't know where they came from. They just kind of showed up while i was playing gambit. I assume. I got An engram drop.
Trissin [SEP] actually i think have opened a few exotics, but they are all Y1
Arixama [SEP] I pulled a prospector from a powerful gear bounty.
Arixama [SEP] It's felt less bad cause it was after i got the geomags
Trissin [SEP] lol
Trissin [SEP] so i guess now the question is geomags vs chromatic fire
Arixama [SEP] Geomags mostly. Depends on modifiers.
Trissin [SEP] huh, interesting
Trissin [SEP] they're that good?
RonInDune [SEP] Oh yeah those were some tricky jumps! I was so happy to find that I could actually make it over there
Arixama [SEP] So, in between the 1st and 2nd number of the magazine in your gun is when you can start topping off.
Trissin [SEP] i see
Arixama [SEP] So like with orbs and the chance of the little energy things that drop for storm callers, it's pretty easy to get up. Especially if you chain supers.
Aberration [SEP] it's all about them ions
Masrim [SEP] I hate these Baron missions
TheCnC [SEP] OATH
TheCnC [SEP] OATH WE NEED YOU
TheCnC [SEP] The Crucible Can Wait Oath
TheCnC [SEP] We have to save the dreaming city
TheCnC [SEP] Don't let our two hours in here be in vain!
TheCnC [SEP] WTB Light Level 570 Guardian PST
AY AY RON [SEP] @PC anyone for nightfall?
Oathbreaker [SEP] @TheCnC I AM SO SORRY, I'VE BEEN GOING CRAZY IN CRUCIBLE
Arixama [SEP] Nah, it's chill
RonInDune [SEP] Oh man I didn't know Destiny had a bad reputation among general gamers.
RonInDune [SEP] Someone I know IRL told me I shouldn't support the game because of so many anti-consumer practices by Bungie.
RonInDune [SEP] Anyone know what he talking about?
Oathbreaker [SEP] Probably Eververse. When the game launched, it was not great.
Arixama [SEP] That, or being an online multiplayer that has content locked behind dlc.
Oathbreaker [SEP] On top of that, XP throttling in CoO. There have been a few times Bungie has been caught by the community doing something not so great. They generally fix it quick but it still happened.
Oathbreaker [SEP] That as well Ari.
Arixama [SEP] Which is kind of silly, cause that's fairly common in any sort of subscription based game such as WoW
RonInDune [SEP] Oh man that's disappointing.
RonInDune [SEP] But informative, thank you Ari and Oath. I'll read up a bit.
TheCnC [SEP] @Oathbreaker Oh I know.  I was being more sarcastic and kidding than anything.
Trissin [SEP] !gambit meta pc
RonInDune [SEP] I've not had a single successful gambit PvP kill with the Two Tailed fox yet but dammit I'm never gonna give up.
Helatia [SEP] That's the spirit!
Trissin [SEP] I'm wondering.. who's free tonight?
Trissin [SEP] Thinking of raiding perhaps, if people are interested
Arixama [SEP] I should be
RonInDune [SEP] I am! But I'm at 541 still.
Thawxtem [SEP] Get off work around 7:15 CST, then have to eat. If we get a group, I’m 561-3, only one armor slot missing the Blessing mod, though clearing tier 4 well can fix that
Helatia [SEP] I'm down and I am sure Gimmie will be down as well
Thawxtem [SEP] Heavy lighting at the moment. I’ll wait to see if it calms down
Thawxtem [SEP] gtg
Thawxtem [SEP] @Trissin @Arixama @RonInDune are we still good for raid tonight?
RonInDune [SEP] Yup
Helatia [SEP] Gimmie and I are good
Helatia [SEP] @Trissin @Arixama Y'all alive? lol
Arixama [SEP] i am
Helatia [SEP] Sweet
Trissin [SEP] oups , sorry!!! i forgot
RonInDune [SEP] WElp I'm having internet issues
RonInDune [SEP] COnstantly disconnecting with weasel and bee
RonInDune [SEP] And now saxophone
Helatia [SEP] Still having issues?
RonInDune [SEP] Yeah I think something broke in my ISP
RonInDune [SEP] Sorry guys
RonInDune [SEP] I'll try to join intermittently, but you should look for another meanwhile.
Oathbreaker [SEP] Just got home from work unfortunately, work tomorrow as well otherwise I'd be so so down.
Trissin [SEP] how was the raid???
Trissin [SEP] im so sorry i had to go out
RonInDune [SEP] I too feel bad I couldn't join in. I've been getting bee errors all day.
Arixama [SEP] good, we almost got through the second encounter.
Trissin [SEP] oh nice!!
Trissin [SEP] is that shuro chi?
Arixama [SEP] yeah
Trissin [SEP] good for u guys!
Trissin [SEP] what are people doing now
Arixama [SEP] im going to bed
RonInDune [SEP] Anyone up for blind wells btw?
Trissin [SEP] oh i might do some blind well
Trissin [SEP] night ari
Peronix [SEP] I’ve finally hit 540 LL. Just another 60 to go
Arixama [SEP] gratz
RonInDune [SEP] Yo can anyone help me with the ascendant challenge? I keep dying to the boss.
Arixama [SEP] I got you
RonInDune [SEP] Thanks Ari!
AY AY RON [SEP] @PC nightfall anyone?
Aberration [SEP] Nf is 540 LL?
AY AY RON [SEP] yup
AY AY RON [SEP] doable if you're around 530ish
Aberration [SEP] Hmm..yeah I'm low 530s
AY AY RON [SEP] yeah that should be high enough, just cant rambo through everything
Aberration [SEP] Got it. I'll give it a shot haha
AY AY RON [SEP] great, i'll toss you an invite
Thawxtem [SEP] Raid group from Saturday... are we still going to try to finish?
RonInDune [SEP] Man Bungie has seriously upped the exotic loot drop. I got 4 exotics (2 forsaken) over the weekend, roughly 5 hours of play.
Trissin [SEP] 😠
Trissin [SEP] i still have nothing...
Masrim [SEP] i got a hunter chest
Oathbreaker [SEP] Anyone want to grind for the Silicon Neuroma sniper rifle from Pyramidion?
Thawxtem [SEP] why not
Thawxtem [SEP] sure
Oathbreaker [SEP] Alright I'm inviting you now in a second
RonInDune [SEP] Hey I need help with the ascendant challenge again... I keep getting lost on the way and the knights hit hard!
Peronix [SEP] If you still need help, im down to help. Gotta get another thing of queensfoil real quick though
RonInDune [SEP] Heck yeah, thanks man! I gave up after getting bee errored twice in a row
Peronix [SEP] Bungie and errors, name a more inconic duo 😂
RonInDune [SEP] @Trissin and getting Forsaken exotics
Peronix [SEP] Huginn gave me some Queensfoil, so I’m good to go whenever you are
RonInDune [SEP] I'm clearing out the lost sector now
Thawxtem [SEP] Is anyone willing to go through the Whisper Heroic quest a couple times this weekend?
RonInDune [SEP] I've never done the heroic before, so I'm game!
Thawxtem [SEP] That makes two of us! Do you remember how to get past the first room? I couldn't find the taken ball
RonInDune [SEP] No idea mate, let me youtube it.
Thawxtem [SEP] @RonInDune are you available right now? I got a third that knows where to go
RonInDune [SEP] Oh cool coming online give me 2 minutes
Thawxtem [SEP] join fireteam chat
RonInDune [SEP] Hey @Thawxtem can we run the Whisper missions sometime this weekend?
Thawxtem [SEP] Maybe Sunday
RonInDune [SEP] That's cool

Mr.Kaeron [SEP] that would be so nice of u

Trissin [SEP] haha no worries, all good !
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] does it make it a lot harder with you carrying me?
Trissin [SEP] uhh... I don't think so
Trissin [SEP] I dont think it gets harder based on the # of people
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] is it ok if I bring a friend as well? some1 from the clan?
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] dont wanna abuse ur goodwill
Trissin [SEP] haha of course you can bring more people
Trissin [SEP] doesn't have to be from the clan.. you should be able to invite anybody

Masrim [SEP] nice
Thawxtem [SEP] @RonInDune launching D2, let me know when you're ready by joining the voice channel
Thawxtem [SEP] running by Xur first
RonInDune [SEP] Alright, I'm coming online within a couple of minutes
RonInDune [SEP] We do need a third though ...
Thawxtem [SEP] @PC looking for a third for Whisper quest Heroic
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] what the rep for that?
Thawxtem [SEP] ?
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] power lvl
RonInDune [SEP] 400 I think
Thawxtem [SEP] 400 recommended according to Destiny, I'm at 583
Thawxtem [SEP] what are you at Ron?
RonInDune [SEP] 580
Thawxtem [SEP] Luckily Xur is on Io this week, so I'll just be hanging out there
RonInDune [SEP] Alright lemme clear some inventory and I'll join in
RonInDune [SEP] No third yet?
Thawxtem [SEP] @Mr.Kaeron you want in?
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] not entirely sure what's that, and what kind of loot does it drop
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] started playing a week a go
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] *ago sorry
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] im at 522
Thawxtem [SEP] Whisper of the Worm is an amazing sniper power weapon, but it requires a quest to obtain. Completing the quest unlocks Heroic. The quest is only available on weekends, though, and can take a little bit of patience to get the right field requirements to spring the quest the first time
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] oh I see
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] I dont think I have that quest tho
Thawxtem [SEP] It’s not on map, you have to kill a certain enemy during a certain public event to spawn a taken portal that leads to the quest
Thawxtem [SEP] Join me if you want to try. Just remember, public events are random, so that’s where patience is required
Thawxtem [SEP] Just join the voice channel as well
Thawxtem [SEP] JOIN NOW
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] ur in the us
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] cant
Oathbreaker [SEP] You can switch servers with no loss of progress
Oathbreaker [SEP] @Mr.Kaeron
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] not sure how tho
Oathbreaker [SEP] I would be more than happy to walk you through, Whisper is that amazing of a weapon.
Oathbreaker [SEP] First things first, if you're in Destiny 2, log out and go to desktop
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] okay
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] done
Oathbreaker [SEP] Open up the Battle.net app, and click on your name in the top right hand corner. In the drop down menu, click log out
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] got it
Mr.Kaeron [SEP] cool
