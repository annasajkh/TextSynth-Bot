Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . __eou__
Can you study with the radio on ? __eou__ No , I listen to background music . __eou__ What is the difference ? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials . __eou__ That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ What kind of house is it ? __eou__ It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . __eou__ Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . __eou__ And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ Right , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . __eou__
How are Zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ It'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__

I don't know how . __eou__ You will . __eou__ Oh ... __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__

I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you .

I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . __eou__ Thank you for you help . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__

Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser .

I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? __eou__ Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Sure .

how do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ do you have a car ? __eou__ no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ you could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__

I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather ?

It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
On , darn . The grocery store is closed . __eou__ Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . __eou__ Alright . We are out of everything . __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . __eou__ I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . __eou__ Yeah , and the prices there are very high . __eou__ I know . Three dollars for milk . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ You can count on it . __eou__ I think so.Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him.He ' s good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__

Then we will visit the University Museum . __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink ? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . __eou__ Good . I will have hot chocolate . __eou__ A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . __eou__ Sorry . How far is the museum ? __eou__ I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . __eou__ Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . __eou__
How about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That's great . What's on tonight ? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__ Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ On the contrary , very exciting . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . __eou__ Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__ Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__ How dreadful ! __eou__ Look at the view from the window . __eou__ Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__ It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? __eou__ Well , I like playing the violin . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? __eou__ About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . __eou__ That's really interesting . __eou__ Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . __eou__ Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . __eou__
How can I tell her about this ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ How can you live without job in the future ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
Are you going to the party on Saturday ? __eou__ I was thinking about it . Are you ? __eou__ Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? Well , what time does it start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ Everyone from school . __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . __eou__ Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party ? __eou__ Yeah , I will be there . __eou__
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? __eou__ Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? __eou__ Am I failing ? __eou__ Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? __eou__ I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . __eou__ I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__ I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . __eou__ Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? __eou__ I'll try ; it's hard ! __eou__ Thanks for stopping by ! __eou__
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Is the clock right ? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little . __eou__ By how many minutes ? __eou__ Two . __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . __eou__ Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . __eou__ You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . __eou__ Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . __eou__ You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . __eou__ Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? __eou__ I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . __eou__ Are you going to have a birthday party ? __eou__ Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Why are you shivering ? __eou__ It's freezing . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? __eou__ Sure , I have . Will you join ? __eou__ I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . __eou__ You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? __eou__ The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . __eou__ He is cute.What dose he do ? __eou__ I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . __eou__ Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . __eou__ And I bet you studied , too . __eou__ Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . __eou__ That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? __eou__ Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! __eou__
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . __eou__ What's the route ? __eou__ From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . __eou__ If only I could join it ! __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . __eou__ Have you ever been to America ? __eou__ No , but I'd really like to . __eou__ You'd like it . __eou__
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__ Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__ Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__ Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__ Yeah , it sure would . __eou__
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in ? __eou__ Which room are you in ? __eou__ 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . __eou__ I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . __eou__
Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . __eou__ Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! __eou__ You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? __eou__ Not only that ! __eou__ Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! __eou__ OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work hard . __eou__
The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ No , please feel free . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Do you work in Shanghai ? __eou__ Yes I do . How about you ? __eou__ No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . __eou__ You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? __eou__ Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! __eou__ Uh huh ... __eou__
Look at this headline , Soo Mi . __eou__ Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! __eou__ Is it the same in Korea ? __eou__ I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . __eou__ Do people get married young ? __eou__ Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . __eou__ Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? __eou__ No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . __eou__
Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . __eou__ The beauty under the tree ? __eou__ Of course.No girl is more charming . __eou__ She is a young man ! __eou__
Excuse me.Where do I register ? __eou__ Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . __eou__ Is that the large , white building ? __eou__ Yeah , that's it . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
How was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? __eou__ She's my grandma . __eou__ She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? __eou__ 92 . __eou__
Mom . My legs are killing me . __eou__ Hold on . We will be successful right away . __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . __eou__
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . __eou__ So what's the problem ? __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Which pair of jeans do you like best ? __eou__ I really like the straight legs . __eou__ But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? __eou__ I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . __eou__ That's the style ! You just wear boxers . __eou__ What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? __eou__ You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! __eou__ If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! __eou__
Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . __eou__ Do you have a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , my wife is coming to get me . __eou__ That's good . Do you live near here ? __eou__ No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? __eou__ I live downtown , with my parents . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ I don't need a car . I walk to work . __eou__ You're lucky ! __eou__
Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! __eou__ Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! __eou__ I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . __eou__ Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . __eou__ That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . __eou__ I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? __eou__ Always . __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday ? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . __eou__ How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . __eou__ OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . __eou__
How about seconds , Victor ? __eou__ No.thanks . I'm full . __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__
Cigarette ? __eou__ Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , here . __eou__ Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . __eou__ I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . __eou__ Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__
Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? __eou__ Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ Well , Rose . __eou__ Is there something any need ? __eou__ Are your free this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I have nothing to do . __eou__ Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? __eou__ Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . __eou__ OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__ I'll be there on time . __eou__
How do you shoot pool ? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ And ? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ Can I get the black ball in ? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ Let's go and try now ! __eou__
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? __eou__ I'd enjoy that . __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . __eou__ OK . I'll see you then . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__
Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . __eou__ Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . __eou__ It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__
Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? __eou__ I'm afraid so . __eou__
What do you think of the coming match ? __eou__ Winning is a piece of cake to me . __eou__ You are bragging again . __eou__
What would you reckon the taxing increases ? __eou__ Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . __eou__ But what do most people think about it ? __eou__ Ah , it ’ s hard to say . __eou__
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . __eou__ Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? __eou__ What ? Beg your pardon . __eou__ John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . __eou__ I just cann't believe my ears ! __eou__
What do you need ? __eou__ I need to use the Internet . __eou__ You have your library card , right ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ There is a wait right now to use the computers . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Would you please write your name on this list ? __eou__ Then what ? __eou__ I will call you when a computer is free . __eou__ How do I log on to the computer ? __eou__ Use the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . __eou__
What a nice tie you are wearing ! __eou__ Thank you.But does it really look all right ? __eou__ Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . __eou__ Then does it go well with my sweater ? __eou__ Yes.You look very smart today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What do you make of the case ? __eou__ If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . __eou__ What do you mean by saying so ? __eou__ I mean it ’ s not his fault . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? __eou__
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
I have a real problem when I meet people . __eou__ What is it ? Maybe I can help . __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ That sounds easy enough . __eou__ Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . __eou__ I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . __eou__
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them . __eou__ After you . __eou__
When do you usually go to the movies ? __eou__ I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? __eou__ The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . __eou__ That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again ? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying . __eou__ All right . But what was the trouble ? __eou__ My car run out of petrol . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? __eou__ No , Jess , chill out ! __eou__
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . __eou__
Do you often buy magazines ? __eou__ I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? __eou__ Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . __eou__ Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? __eou__ Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . __eou__ Do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? __eou__ I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . __eou__
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . __eou__ It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . __eou__ Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . __eou__ I'm sorry . What's your name again ? __eou__ Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . __eou__ So Barb ... what do you do ? __eou__ I'm studying medicine . __eou__ Really ? Where ? __eou__ At Harvard . What about you ? __eou__ I'm an engineer at IBM . __eou__ Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . __eou__ Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . __eou__ Good . I'm starving . __eou__
Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ you mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ it must be very demanding . __eou__ sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ Which is easier to learn ? __eou__ Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . __eou__
Jim , how was your weekend ? __eou__ I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . __eou__ That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? __eou__ Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to go there myself . __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__
It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . __eou__ I did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__ If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . __eou__ But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . __eou__
What is the correct time , please ? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ When will the lecture begin ? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . __eou__
Should I ask Sara to the party ? __eou__ I would if I were you . __eou__
If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . __eou__ You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . __eou__ Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . __eou__
We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? __eou__ What is a sixties party ? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties . __eou__ That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . __eou__ Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? __eou__ That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player ! __eou__
I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . __eou__ Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . __eou__ I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . __eou__ A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . __eou__ Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
The music has started . __eou__ How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice . __eou__ May I ask you for a dance ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? __eou__ Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . __eou__ I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . __eou__ But I have an appointment with Ann . __eou__ Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . __eou__ I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . __eou__ I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . __eou__ But I think time can change everything . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget.Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . __eou__ Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? __eou__ Yep . And I should start planning now . __eou__ Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? __eou__ Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . __eou__ How Ay days will the reunion be ? __eou__ Usually it's at least five days and four nights . __eou__ This is going to be a major production for you ! __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__

I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . __eou__

I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__

What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ How about tango ? __eou__ Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) __eou__ Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ That's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ When are getting married ? __eou__ Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ Congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__
Can you speak French ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? __eou__ More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? __eou__ About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e __eou__
you look better today . How did your test go ? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday . __eou__ did you pass ? __eou__ I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! __eou__ you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . __eou__ thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . __eou__ you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . __eou__ did you always do well at school ? __eou__ no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . __eou__ really ? __eou__ sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months . __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams ? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead . __eou__ do you think that's a good idea ? __eou__ no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! __eou__
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? __eou__ Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? __eou__ Sure , which beach are we going to ? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach . __eou__ I like Santa Monica . __eou__ The water there looks so dirty . __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__ I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice ? __eou__ It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu ? __eou__ If that's okay with you . __eou__ Sure , let's go to Malibu . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . __eou__ You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! __eou__ Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . __eou__ When did you change your mind ? __eou__ After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . __eou__ I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? __eou__ Yeah . I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am trying to find this book . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . __eou__ Have you checked the computer ? __eou__ I have already . __eou__ What did it say ? __eou__ It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . __eou__ I can always borrow the book from another library . __eou__ You can do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . __eou__
ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? __eou__ We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . __eou__ What is the rate ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . __eou__ How about mileage and gas ? __eou__ There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . __eou__ OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . __eou__ All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . __eou__ How long is the holiday ? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time . __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ But a taxi costs too much . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__ just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . __eou__ sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . __eou__
I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
What are you two doing in here ? __eou__ We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . __eou__ I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . __eou__ Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . __eou__ All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? __eou__ I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... __eou__
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . __eou__
Dad , what's the date ? __eou__ It's December eighteenth . __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I know that . __eou__ So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? __eou__ Sure , a promise is a promise . __eou__
What happen , John ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Why do you look unhappy ? __eou__ I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? __eou__ Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . __eou__
Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? __eou__ No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... __eou__ It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats ? __eou__ No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... __eou__ Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? __eou__ You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . __eou__ Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! __eou__
The world changes , the family changes too . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . __eou__ That is called a nuclear family . __eou__ I don't like such a family . __eou__ What kind of family are you like ? __eou__ I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . __eou__ It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . __eou__ We can live well , I think . __eou__
What was that all about ? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion . __eou__ Is she going to be okay ? __eou__ She'll be fine . __eou__
Is sailing fun ? __eou__ You bet ! __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__ Right . __eou__
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . __eou__ I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . __eou__ Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . __eou__
Good morning , Loans . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence . __eou__ Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . __eou__ Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__
Which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ Isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't have much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . __eou__ I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . __eou__ No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . __eou__ I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . __eou__ Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? __eou__ Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . __eou__ The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__ Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__ I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__ Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__ Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . __eou__ Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice in Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? __eou__ There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . __eou__ I feel it's rather dry here . __eou__ That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . __eou__ Are you from the south ? __eou__ No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . __eou__ I see.so this is your hometown ? __eou__
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__ It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__ Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . __eou__ And the streets are covered with snow . __eou__ Do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . __eou__ It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__ The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__ That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__
Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . __eou__ You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? __eou__ Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . __eou__ Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . __eou__ OK , they begin to register . __eou__ It's time I left . __eou__ Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . __eou__
What are your working hours ? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . __eou__ Much better than mine . __eou__ What are your hours ? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? __eou__ For What ? __eou__ Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . __eou__ Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? __eou__ I went to Yale University . __eou__ Did you ? And what did you study ? __eou__ I have a B . A . in Economics . __eou__ Would you mind telling me how old you are ? __eou__ I'm twenty-seven . __eou__ And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? __eou__ Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . __eou__ And what was your salary at the bank ? __eou__ I got $ 500 a week . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a doctor . __eou__ Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__ I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__ Oh , do you enjoy it ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . __eou__
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__ that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__ all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . __eou__ thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ now let's have one together . __eou__ do you know how to set the timer ? __eou__ let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ cheese ... __eou__ did it come out ? __eou__ yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__ never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__ Ok , let's go . __eou__

I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__ What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__ How did it finish ? __eou__ It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? __eou__ It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__ No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . __eou__

I am sure things will turn note , ok ? __eou__ I am not . she is no picnic . __eou__ Well . if you think I can help , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , Serena . __eou__

What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? __eou__ Sure.Where would you suggest ? __eou__ How about going to the suburbs ? __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious .

Where's Tom this evening ? __eou__ He's a little sick under the weather . __eou__ Really ! What's the matter with him ? __eou__ He has the flu . __eou__ Tell him I was asking about him . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Maybe you should talk to the teacher . __eou__ No , it's no use . __eou__ You never know unless you try . __eou__ I know . She won't change my grade . __eou__
well , I finished my last final today . __eou__ the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! __eou__ do you want to attend the convocation ? __eou__ certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? __eou__ oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . __eou__ no . those you have to provide for yourself . __eou__ what do most of the students do ? __eou__ well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f __eou__ then , I might as well have them made . __eou__ Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . __eou__ hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . __eou__ it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . __eou__ here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? __eou__ Certainly . Ok , got you . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
Good morning , Sue . __eou__ Good morning , Tom.How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? __eou__ Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am heading for the library .

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? __eou__ It's 5:30 by my watch . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . __eou__
I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . __eou__ Are you angry , Lisa ? __eou__ Angry ? Why would I be ? __eou__ Please don't tell my mom . __eou__ Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . __eou__ I'm glad that you see it that way . __eou__ Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . __eou__ Thank you so much , Lisa ! __eou__
Hi , Mary , long time no see . __eou__ I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . __eou__ Yes , next March . __eou__ Congratulations , I hope everything works out . __eou__
Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? __eou__ I wouldn't say so . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . __eou__
is everything alright ? __eou__ yes , everything is fine . __eou__ what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__ then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! __eou__ we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . __eou__ so where did you land ? __eou__ we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__ it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__ have you had anything to eat ? __eou__ I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? __eou__ I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Today is December 23,2002 . __eou__ Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you ! __eou__
Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . __eou__ Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . __eou__ It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . __eou__ We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? __eou__ About 4 . __eou__ OK . Do you want us to bring something ? __eou__ No , just come here . __eou__ OK , see you later . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . __eou__ That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . __eou__
Thanks for coming shopping with me . __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . __eou__ You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . __eou__ Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . __eou__ I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . __eou__ The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? __eou__ These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . __eou__
I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like fat girls . __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? __eou__ I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . __eou__ Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . __eou__ Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! __eou__ Master Li ? Who's that ? __eou__ He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! __eou__ I will ! I could use some good luck ! __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ It's Thursday , I think . __eou__ Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . __eou__ We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . __eou__ We'll meet again in a few days . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__
What day is it today ? __eou__ It's Friday . __eou__
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . __eou__
There is something wrong with my girlfriend . __eou__ What's the trouble ? __eou__ The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . __eou__ What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? __eou__ Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? __eou__
Are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ Sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . __eou__ I have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Did you hear Peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How's your married life ? __eou__ We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . __eou__ That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . __eou__ The situation differs in person . __eou__
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! __eou__ I felt as if I had been in a different world . __eou__ And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . __eou__
I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . __eou__ Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? __eou__ Nonsmoking , please . __eou__ All right . May I have your name ? __eou__ My surname is Gao . __eou__ How do you spell it , sir ? __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! __eou__ oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . __eou__ it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . __eou__ but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . __eou__ why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . __eou__ she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . __eou__ that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? __eou__ I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . __eou__ I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . __eou__ I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? __eou__ just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . __eou__ do you think it will work ? __eou__ sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . __eou__ ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . __eou__ sure . Good luck , Maria ! __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ What is very difficult to gather team player together . __eou__ I usually play with my school-mates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . __eou__
Why are you all dressed up ? __eou__ I've got a date . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__
Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . __eou__ I was playing a joke on you . __eou__ That ’ s too much . __eou__ Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I ’ m going to Hainan . __eou__ Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? __eou__ Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . __eou__ I see . What ’ s it like there ? __eou__ Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! __eou__ Well , have a great time ! __eou__
Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . __eou__ All right , Sis ! __eou__ Come on , it's cool outside . __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . __eou__ Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? __eou__ Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . __eou__ What ? Are you crazy ? __eou__ I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . __eou__ Ew , Danny , gross ! __eou__ By the way , what's your favorite weather ? __eou__ I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . __eou__ Look , is that Tom ? __eou__
My girlfriend dumped me . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__
Did Roll win the race ? __eou__ Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . __eou__ But anyway , he won at last . __eou__ Yeah . To win is the most important thing . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
Hey , This is your order . __eou__ Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . __eou__ Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? __eou__ Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? __eou__ OK . But I'd like some cookies . __eou__ Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . __eou__ I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__ Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__ It's OK . Thank you . __eou__
Do you think the bad weather will last long ? __eou__ I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . __eou__ I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . __eou__ Good idea . Thanks a billion . __eou__
Let's go in . __eou__ After you . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget . Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive ? __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! __eou__ Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . __eou__ I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ Would you like to have lunch with me ? __eou__ Yes . When ? __eou__ Is 11:30 AM OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? __eou__ I said , 11:30 AM . __eou__ Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? __eou__ OK , how about 12:30 PM ? __eou__ OK . Where ? __eou__ How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? __eou__ Oh , Where is that ? __eou__ It's on 7th Street . __eou__ OK , I'll meet you there . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How about you ? __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . __eou__ Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . __eou__ I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . __eou__ OK.See you on Today . __eou__ See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . __eou__ You too.Thanks for dropping in . __eou__
Are you really dating with Frank ? __eou__ Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . __eou__ Then why not keep away from him ? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__ That ’ s stupid . __eou__
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . __eou__ I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding . __eou__
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? __eou__ I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . __eou__ What do you like best about it ? __eou__ I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . __eou__ What do you think of the ending ? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . __eou__
Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . __eou__ Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ Yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . __eou__ I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Forget it . __eou__ I don't think I performed well . __eou__ Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . __eou__ Can you tell me how to improve myself ? __eou__ There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . __eou__ Thank you for your encouragement . __eou__ It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'll leave at 10 o'clock . __eou__ Take care and give my best to you parents . __eou__ Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to get on the Internet . __eou__ Do you have your library card with you ? __eou__ Yes , I have it . __eou__ You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . __eou__ That ’ s okay . __eou__ Please put your name on this list . __eou__ Then what do I need to do ? __eou__ When there is a computer available , I will call you . __eou__ What do I do to log on to the computer ? __eou__ Just type in the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Okay . Thanks for your help . __eou__
Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? __eou__ Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? __eou__ Aug 8 . __eou__ August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? __eou__ Mrs . White . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . __eou__ Maybe her uncle will . __eou__ I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? __eou__ Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes , Jane says they will go to China . __eou__
Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . __eou__ No problem . I can deal with it well . __eou__ You will ask for it . __eou__ All is best now , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . __eou__ Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . __eou__ You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . __eou__ Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__ Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
Steve , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__
Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . __eou__ Sure , When is good time for you ? __eou__ Can you make it on Tuesday ? __eou__ What time do you want me there ? __eou__ Anytime after six will be fine . __eou__ All right , It's a date . __eou__
My friend Jean is very beautiful . __eou__ What's her figure ? __eou__ Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . __eou__ What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ Dark blue . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man . __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house . __eou__ Any time . I'm just glad I could help . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . __eou__ Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? __eou__ Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? __eou__ I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . __eou__ When can you come ? __eou__ I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . __eou__
You know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Why don't you try to give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . __eou__ Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should have another try . __eou__
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? __eou__ Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__ Why ? What was it about ? __eou__ It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , __eou__ I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ It's a fifteen-minute intermission . __eou__ The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I can't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . __eou__ Do you have large concert halls in your city ? __eou__ We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . __eou__ That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ What time will the library be closing ? __eou__ It closes at six . __eou__ Does it always close at six ? __eou__ No , not every day . __eou__ Will the library be open on Saturday ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ What are your hours on Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . __eou__ All right .

Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . __eou__ Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . __eou__ It isn't Elvin . __eou__ Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . __eou__ Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . __eou__

What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__
Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea .

That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . __eou__ Is there a swimming pool in your school ? __eou__ Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . __eou__ I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . __eou__ I believe that you can make your dream come true . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__

See you later ! __eou__ See you later ! Drive carefully . __eou__

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it .

Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__

We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill .

Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . __eou__ That's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . __eou__
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__ Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please .

Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal .

He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Bill ! __eou__ Merry Christmas . Steven ! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping .

It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just !

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
I don't have my homework today . __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? __eou__ I was really sick . __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? __eou__ Yes , I probably could . __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? __eou__ Next class meeting . __eou__ That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? __eou__ That would work for me . __eou__ Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__
Thanks for helping me up . __eou__ Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here .

Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__

I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis .

It was an exciting match . __eou__
Where is your native place ? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ So are you a local ? __eou__ Yes , I am a local resident . __eou__

I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . __eou__ What kind of scholarship is it ? __eou__ It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . __eou__ Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . __eou__ I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . __eou__ Excellent .

The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . __eou__ Do you have an essay you want to send them ? __eou__ No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . __eou__ What is the question ? __eou__ They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . __eou__ That's a pretty short essay . __eou__ Yes , but I need to write it by next week . __eou__ Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . __eou__ I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . __eou__ Sure . What are they ? __eou__ First , I need a letter of recommendation . __eou__ I'd be happy to write one for you . __eou__ And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . __eou__ What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? __eou__ Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . __eou__ Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . __eou__ I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . __eou__ Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . __eou__ That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . __eou__ Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will . __eou__
You look pale today . __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning . __eou__ You should do sports to keep young . __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . __eou__
