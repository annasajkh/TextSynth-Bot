Say, Jim, how about going for a few beers after dinner? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness. __eou__ What do you mean? It will help us to relax. __eou__ Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home. __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends. __eou__ That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them. __eou__ Sounds great to me! If they are willing, we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun, too. __eou__ Good.Let's go now. __eou__ All right. __eou__
Can you do push-ups? __eou__ Of course I can. It's a piece of cake! Believe it or not, I can do 30 push-ups a minute. __eou__ Really? I think that's impossible! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups? __eou__ Yeah! __eou__ It's easy. If you do exercise everyday, you can make it, too. __eou__
Can you study with the radio on? __eou__ No, I listen to background music. __eou__ What is the difference? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials. __eou__ That's true, but then you have to buy a record player. __eou__
Are you all right? __eou__ I will be all right soon. I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire. __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat  __eou__ I see. __eou__
Hey John, nice skates. Are they new? __eou__ Yeah, I just got them. I started playing ice hockey in a community league. So, I finally got myself new skates. __eou__ What position do you play? __eou__ I'm a defender. It's a lot of fun. You don't have to be able to skate as fast on defense. __eou__ Yeah, you're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, myself. __eou__ Oh, yeah? Which team? __eou__ The Rockets. __eou__ Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later. __eou__ All right, see you later. __eou__
Hey Lydia, what are you reading? __eou__ I'm looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling! __eou__ What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes? __eou__ It's a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries. When were you born? __eou__ January 5th. __eou__ Let's see... you're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers! __eou__ That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. __eou__ No, it's not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. __eou__ Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you! __eou__
Frank's getting married, do you believe this? __eou__ Is he really? __eou__ Yes, he is. He loves the girl very much. __eou__ Who is he marring? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think. __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding? __eou__ Not yet. __eou__
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs. __eou__ That's right, we bought it the same day we came on the market. __eou__ What kind of house is it? __eou__ It's a wonderful Spanish style. __eou__ Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses. __eou__ And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price. __eou__ Great, is it a two bedroom house? __eou__ No, it has three bedrooms and three beds, and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage. __eou__ That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you. __eou__ Yeas, when will you buy a house? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year, you know, just before my wedding. __eou__ Right, congratulations. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__
Hi, Becky, what's up? __eou__ Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall. __eou__ What's the problem? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she's around. __eou__ For example? __eou__ Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her. __eou__ No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen. __eou__ It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids. __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun. __eou__ You said she used to? How did you stop her? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing, and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things. She understood, and now everything is a lot more peaceful. __eou__ That sounds like a good idea. I'll have to try that. __eou__
How are Zina's new programmers working out? __eou__ I hate to admit it, but they're good. And fast. The Filipino kid is a genius. __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline, and have us up and running next week? __eou__ It'll be close, but we'll make it. __eou__ Good. After Stars.com starts paying us, we won't need Vikam's cash anymore. __eou__ And if we don't need them, we won't need Zina, either. __eou__
Do you like cooking? __eou__ Yes. I like cooking very much. I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold. __eou__ Why do you like it? __eou__ I have no idea. I like cooking by myself. I like to taste delicious food. __eou__ That's wonderful! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes, which I usually test with my friends. You can come, too. __eou__ Really? I hope I can have a chance to taste it. Don't forget to tell me. __eou__ Certainly. __eou__
Anyone home? Jen! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen... let yourself in! __eou__ Wow! You're really working up a storm! __eou__ I know. I've even worked up a sweat. __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier. __eou__
You look so tan and healthy! __eou__ Thanks. I just got back from summer camp. __eou__ How was it? __eou__ Great. I got to try so many things for the first time. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ I went sailing, fishing, and horseback riding. __eou__ I'm so jealous. __eou__ The counselors were so nice too. It was the best summer ever. Except for all those mosquitoes! __eou__
Diana, do you like the perfume I gave you? __eou__ It's good. But to tell you the truth, I don't wear perfume. __eou__ I'm sorry. I didn't know that. __eou__ That's all right. Thank you all the same. __eou__
Ah, ah, ah... __eou__ All right, Bill.Here's your daily exercise schedule. You are to jog before breakfast. __eou__ Jog? __eou__ Then, you are to walk to work. __eou__ Walk? __eou__ Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time. __eou__ Oh no. __eou__ Use the stairs, never the elevator. __eou__ Oh, dear. __eou__ And three times a week, you can either swim, play racketball, or hand ball. __eou__ Oh no. __eou__ OK, you can stop now.It's time for the dance class. __eou__ Dance class! I don't know how. __eou__ You will. __eou__ Oh... __eou__
Hi Bill, I saw your grandma yesterday. __eou__ Oh where was that? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track. __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods. __eou__ Well, it pays off for her.How old is she anyway? __eou__ She will be 86 next month. __eou__ That is truly amazing! __eou__
I would like to register for a class today. __eou__ No problem, what class would you like to take? __eou__ I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy. __eou__ There are two classes that are still open. __eou__ Which days are these classes on? __eou__ The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three. __eou__ What about the other class? __eou__ The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12. __eou__ Are you sure there are no more open classes? __eou__ I'm positive. __eou__ Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday. __eou__ Okay, I'll sign you up. __eou__
Dad, why are you taping the windows? __eou__ Honey, a typhoon is coming. __eou__ Really? Wow, I don't have to go to school tomorrow. __eou__ Jenny, come and help, we need to prepare more food. __eou__ OK. Dad! I'm coming. __eou__
Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia. __eou__ Nice to meet you, Lean. My name is Alike. I'm from Japan. __eou__ To me English is a difficult language. __eou__ A second language is always difficult. __eou__ True, but English is harder than most. It's a crazy language. __eou__ A crazy language? Why do you say that? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings. __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language. __eou__
Can I help you? __eou__ I hope so. I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing, and I'm not quite sure where to look. __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you. What topic is your paper on? __eou__ My paper is on the influence of television on children. __eou__ There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television. __eou__ Thank you for you help. __eou__
Here's your hot dog and beer. What happened? Did I miss anything? __eou__ Yeah, Cal Ripen just hit a home run. __eou__ What's the score? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4, but Ripen's home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base. __eou__ So Baltimore is winning? __eou__ Right. __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game. __eou__ Yeah, there isn't a bad seat in the place. __eou__ The fans are great here, too. Not like in Philadelphia. __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game. __eou__ Yeah, it reminds you why they say baseball is America's favorite pastime. __eou__
How do you like the pizza here? __eou__ Perfect. It really hits the spot. __eou__
Do you have a light? __eou__ Sorry, I don't smoke. __eou__
I was scared stiff of giving my first performance. __eou__ Were you? your performance was excellent. __eou__ Thank you for your kindly words. __eou__
Excuse me. Could you please take a picture of us with this camera? __eou__ Sure. Which button do I press to shoot? __eou__ This one. __eou__ Do I have to focus it? __eou__ No, this is a focus-free camera. All you have to do is point and press the button. __eou__ All right. Say cheese! __eou__
Every country should face the history. __eou__ Yeah, we don't live in the vacuum. We have traditional values and long but different history. __eou__ Sometimes, we, human beings, really had done something wrong, so we should admit it at first. __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history. __eou__ I believe such things won't be realized, just daydreaming. __eou__
Do you like traveling, Kathy? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance. But I don't like traveling to work, waiting for buses, or... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you're driving. __eou__ Exactly. __eou__
Your house is too small. Why not buy a big one. __eou__ I do wish I could afford one. __eou__ You can get a loan from the bank. You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases. __eou__ Of course I know that. But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing? __eou__
How do you do, Prof.Smith. __eou__ How do you do, Ms. Yang.You speak very good English. __eou__ Thank you. I begin to like English even when I was a child. __eou__ Where did you learn it? __eou__ At school, in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country. __eou__ It's amazing. __eou__
Do you want black or white coffee? __eou__ White, please __eou__ Look! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening. Do you Want to go? __eou__ I don't like Folk music very much. __eou__ What kind of music do you like? __eou__ I like classical music. Do you? __eou__ Not very much. Classical music sends me to sleep __eou__ I don't believe you. __eou__ It's true. __eou__ You are funny! __eou__ So are you! How about another coffee? __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time? __eou__ I like playing chess. __eou__ Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess? __eou__ I'm afraid not. __eou__ Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that? __eou__ Oh, yes. I like playing basketball. __eou__ Can you tell me why you like it? __eou__ Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others. __eou__
Where is John? I can't find him anywhere. __eou__ Haven't you heard that he is in prison? __eou__ What? Beg your pardon. __eou__ John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing. __eou__ I just cann't believe my ears! __eou__
Can I help you? __eou__ I hope so. I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing, and I'm not quite sure where to look. __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on? __eou__ My paper is on the influence of television on children. __eou__ There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television. __eou__ Thank you for you help. __eou__
Hey, Ted. What are you up to this Friday? __eou__ Well, I have the day off from work. __eou__ That's great! Do you have any plans? __eou__ Well, I'Ve been working so hard lately, so I'll probably just take it easy. __eou__ Sounds nice. __eou__ Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies. __eou__ Can I stop by? __eou__ Sure. Any time. __eou__
You honestly believe the world's improving every year? __eou__ Yes, I do. I think that science is making us wiser. What do you think? __eou__ I don't think you're right there. __eou__ I believe industry is making us wealthier. __eou__ I don't believe that. __eou__ And in my opinion, medicine is making us healthier. __eou__ I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, aren't we? __eou__ I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago. __eou__ That's your opinion not mine. __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends, Mum. __eou__ How about a party at home? That way we can get together and celebrate it. __eou__ OK, Mum. I'll invite my friends home. __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I would like to return this book. __eou__ Is that all you need? __eou__ I also want to check out this video. __eou__ Is that all you would like to check out? __eou__ That's all I need. __eou__ Do you have your library card? __eou__ Here it is. __eou__ Make sure to take proper care of this video. __eou__ That won't be a problem. __eou__ If you damage the video, you will be fined. __eou__ I won't damage it. __eou__
What's the matter with you then? You look miserable. __eou__ It's us. __eou__ What do you mean by us. __eou__ Well, you always say you're busy. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself. __eou__ I... I... I miss my parents, also they miss me. __eou__ Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, and you didn't say anything about it. __eou__ You mean I am groaned a few words? __eou__ Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage. __eou__
Hi, Mary. You look pale today. What's the matter with you? __eou__ I think I've caught a cold. Now I'm aching all over. __eou__ You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest. I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon. __eou__ Thank you. I suppose I should go to see a doctor. __eou__
I feel like going for a drink, it's been a long day. __eou__ Great idea! Peter, I could use the drink. __eou__ How about the new bar across road? __eou__ Sounds good. The food there is fantastic, too. __eou__ I agree, I had lunch there last week. __eou__ excellent! That sounds like a plan. __eou__
Could you tell me the right time, please? __eou__ Well. My watch says five past two. But it's no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days. __eou__ You have to go and fix it. __eou__ Yes. I will. __eou__
does your family have a record of your ancestors? __eou__ sure. My mom has been working on our family tree for years. She's always updating it. __eou__ do you have a copy of your family tree in your house? I'd love to see it. __eou__ I can show it to you now, if you like. I think it goes back about 8 generations so far. __eou__ that's amazing. Do you have a large extended family? __eou__ I'Ve got 30 cousins on my mom's side and 10 cousins on my dad's side. __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives. Now that I'm older, I don't spend as much time with them as I used to, so I don't know my younger cousins as well as the older ones. __eou__ I see. who's the head of your household? __eou__ it's definitely my mother. And, her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family. __eou__ that's interesting. What does your grandfather think of your step-mother? __eou__ at first, she was quite critical of her, but now that they'Ve been married for a few years, she's starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother. __eou__ that's pretty much how you feel about your step-mother. Like grandmother, like grandson. __eou__
Hi, Mr. Wang. Do you feel like going boating with me? __eou__ Sounds interesting, I haven't gone boating for some time now, and what time? __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon? __eou__ Sure. Where shall I meet you? __eou__ At the gate of the park. __eou__ Great. I look forward to meeting you. __eou__ See you then. __eou__ See you. __eou__
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend. Did you enjoy it? __eou__ Yes, it's so exciting, though I had the most falls in our skiing team. __eou__ Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski? __eou__ Of course there is. The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration. __eou__ Could you move smoothly? __eou__ Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind. __eou__ What happened afterwards? __eou__ I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop! You can just imagine how terrified I was. __eou__ Poor girl! __eou__
You look pale recently. __eou__ Yeah. I have got much pressure in the company. I have tobe wrapped upon my work. __eou__ Take good care of yourself. __eou__ Thank you. I will. __eou__
Hey, Maggy, Did you hear about David? __eou__ About David? No, I didn't hear anything. __eou__ You know, about David and his new boss. __eou__ Sorry, I don't quite follow you. __eou__ Well, I heard David has been fired. __eou__ Oh, that is a shame. He is really hard working. __eou__
how do you usually get to school? __eou__ I usually ride my bike. Which form of transport do you prefer to use? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle, but when I feel lazy, I drive my car. __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution! __eou__ I agree, but I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient. __eou__ cars might be convenient, but they're so bad for the environment. __eou__ do you have a car? __eou__ no. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it. __eou__ maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it. __eou__ you could try. It would save you a lot of money. __eou__ that's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, insurance, and repairs. __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, you will get lots of exercise, too! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price. __eou__ sounds good! Let's go! __eou__
What's wrong with him? __eou__ His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party. __eou__
What are you going to do for one year abroad, Tom? __eou__ Study, study, study. I want to learn a lot. __eou__ You are going to take courses? __eou__ Yes. I am going to take some university courses there. __eou__ Sounds hard. __eou__ Yes, but I think it's probably for the best. __eou__ Won't you get lonely? __eou__ Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, like fencing, or theater or something. __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather? Will you help me water the flowers, Jack? __eou__ Well, do you think I have to? __eou__ I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days. __eou__ Please look at the sky.Don't you see the dark clouds? It's going to rain soon. __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice. __eou__ Why? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week. __eou__ Oh, I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain. __eou__
On, darn. The grocery store is closed. __eou__ Yeah, this one closes at ten. We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth. __eou__ Alright. We are out of everything. __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day. __eou__ I know, our schedules are so weird. Sometimes, the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that's open when we get home. __eou__ Yeah, and the prices there are very high. __eou__ I know. Three dollars for milk. __eou__
Do you think they two will get married? __eou__ You can count on it. __eou__ I think so.Yes, they get along so well. __eou__ I like him.He's good for her. __eou__ You're right. He sure is. __eou__
Dad, where are we off to? __eou__ First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink. Then we will visit the University Museum. __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner. Can you see that big building at the end of the road? __eou__ Yes? __eou__ That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank. __eou__ Good. I will have hot chocolate. __eou__ A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green. __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you. __eou__ Sorry. How far is the museum? __eou__ I am not sure. We will ask for directions in the coffee shop. __eou__ Here we are. You find us a table and I'll get the drinks. __eou__
How about going to the cinema tonight? __eou__ That's great. What's on tonight? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film, but I know it's a romantic one. __eou__ Romantic? I am afraid I like thrillers better. __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody? __eou__ On the contrary, very exciting. __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable. __eou__ Are you sick? __eou__ No. The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard. It set my teeth on edge. __eou__ He'll finish writing in a minute. __eou__
I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. __eou__ Really? Are you sure? __eou__ Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back. __eou__ Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot! __eou__ Really? __eou__ Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink. __eou__ Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something. __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic. __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing! __eou__
Excuse me, what's the screen near your steering wheel for? __eou__ It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now. __eou__ Oh, that's new to me. So what's on everyday? __eou__ News about current affairs, documentaries, music, movies, noncommercial ads and so on. __eou__ Is there anything interesting? __eou__ Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. __eou__ I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? __eou__ Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. __eou__ That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well? __eou__ Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals. __eou__ I got it. Do you pay for the programs? __eou__ Yes, 50 Yuan per month. __eou__
Oh, no! __eou__ How dreadful! __eou__ Look at the view from the window. __eou__ Oh, dear. That's terrible. Not at all what I expected. __eou__ It's awful, isn't it? __eou__ I can't bear to look at it. I'm rather disappointed. __eou__ It can't be helped. __eou__
What do you do in your free time, Nancy? __eou__ Well, I like playing the violin. __eou__ Really? How long have you been playing the violin? __eou__ About ten years so far. I started learning when I was in middle school. __eou__ That's really interesting. __eou__ Sure. So what about you? Do you have any hobbies? __eou__ Well, I like collecting matchbox! I'm not sure if that counts, though. __eou__ Of course it does. Everybody has his own hobby. __eou__
How can I tell her about this? __eou__ Don't worry, you'll find a way. __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated. __eou__ How can you live without job in the future? __eou__ Don't worry, you'll find a way. __eou__
What sports do you like to play? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball. __eou__ How about football? __eou__ In my country football is brand new, so I never learned the game when I was younger. __eou__ It's a very popular game in America. __eou__ Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun? __eou__ For me, it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play. __eou__ Are you a football player? __eou__ No, I just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football. __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing. __eou__ I see. It's safer then right? __eou__ Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us. __eou__ I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together. __eou__ Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning. __eou__ Great. __eou__
What upsets you? __eou__ My parents called. As usual, they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier said then done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date. __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you? __eou__ I will find one myself, of course. I'm a modern girl. __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, the latest type. __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea. __eou__ No, there is an updated virgin, three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes. __eou__ I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time. __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, so-called love at first sight. __eou__ Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that. __eou__ Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications. Of course, for these sites, you have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, it is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher. __eou__ I don't want to post my personal information on the internet. I'm not knowing who is reading it. __eou__
Are you going to the party on Saturday? __eou__ I was thinking about it. Are you? __eou__ Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun. __eou__ Really? Well, what time does it start? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well, who all is going to be there? __eou__ Everyone from school. __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ, food, and drinks. __eou__ Wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun. __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party? __eou__ Yeah, I will be there. __eou__
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades? __eou__ Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern? __eou__ Am I failing? __eou__ Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well? __eou__ I am pretty sure that I am in trouble. __eou__ I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve? __eou__ I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis. __eou__ Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right? __eou__ I'll try ; it's hard! __eou__ Thanks for stopping by! __eou__
Good luck on your test tomorrow. We'll be crossing our fingers for you! __eou__ Thanks. __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him! __eou__ What happened? Quarrel again? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me? Please! __eou__ Don't ask me. I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel. __eou__
Oh, my God! I've been cheated! __eou__ What? What did you buy? __eou__ It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it! __eou__ What is it? Why did you buy a brick? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick. __eou__ And? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. __eou__ And it's a brick? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box? __eou__ I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. __eou__ Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen. __eou__ Aha! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So, what I think is, you deserve to get cheated! __eou__ C'mon, don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box. __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks. __eou__ You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick? __eou__
Is the clock right? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little. __eou__ By how many minutes? __eou__ Two. __eou__
Hey, Mary, what's up? __eou__ Just so so. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time, so we decided to meet again tonight. __eou__ Oh, that's exciting. What does this guy look like? Is he hot? __eou__ Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! And we have so much in common. We like the same team, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends. __eou__ It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, but when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends. __eou__ Well, that's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty. __eou__ I agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need. __eou__ Yeah, I know. A friend in need is a friend indeed. I don't need fair-weather friends either. __eou__
What's up? You don't look too good. __eou__ Yeah, my head hurts, that's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer! __eou__ I liked physics. It's all math, really. arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. __eou__ Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe. __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me. __eou__ It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. __eou__ Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says. __eou__ Math, sheath. What's the evidence? __eou__ There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH! __eou__ Anyway, it's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that? __eou__ Dude, don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn't you? __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning. But people have different views about lifelong learning. How do you understand lifelong learning? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time? __eou__ I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. __eou__ Then the axiom -'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'doesn't work any longer. __eou__ You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active. __eou__ Me too. To keep up with the changing world, one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things. __eou__ You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French. __eou__ Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France. __eou__ Yes, so I want to learn French to develop my career. __eou__
How old are you? __eou__ Nine... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday? __eou__ I'm older than you! I'll be ten on April 14th. __eou__ Are you going to have a birthday party? __eou__ Maybe. I'll have to ask my mother. __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here! __eou__ Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? __eou__ What's wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking. __eou__ No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight! __eou__ Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before. __eou__ I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand? __eou__ Fine! I want a divorce! __eou__
Why are you shivering? __eou__ It's freezing. __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy. __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy, but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him. __eou__ How come you think of him that way? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance. You should be on the watch out. __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm. __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat. I told you that he's an all-right guy. __eou__ All-right guy? All right. Let's talk about something else instead. __eou__
Cheese! It tastes like cardboard. __eou__ I think so. Maybe that's why it's cheap here. __eou__
Have you signed up to join the company's Christmas party? __eou__ Sure, I have. Will you join? __eou__ I will. You know, as a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere. __eou__ You are right. Our company's Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking. __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there. __eou__ No, it will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, so be careful with that. __eou__ Don't worry, I can handle that. And I know if the boss is there, even it is an informal evening, it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him. __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate, it should rain tomorrow. __eou__ I hope not. Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game. __eou__
hi, Emily, do you know that guy over there? __eou__ The tall one? Sure, that's Drive, he works with Lily. __eou__ He is cute.What dose he do? __eou__ I'm not sure, he is a manager I think. __eou__ Really? Are you going to introduce us? __eou__ Well, he has already taken you know, that's his wife right there. __eou__
You didn't ring me last night. You said you would. __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed. __eou__ That's all right. But why were you so rude to me at lunch. __eou__ Was I? Sorry, I didn't mean to be. I do apologize. __eou__ And why are you yarning now? Are you bored? __eou__ Forgive me darling. I'm very tired. __eou__
Hi, Nicole. Did you have a good weekend? __eou__ Yes, I did. But I feel tired today. __eou__ Really? Why? __eou__ Well, on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis. Then on Sunday I hiked in the country. __eou__ And I bet you studied, too. __eou__ Yeah. I studied on Sunday evening. What about you? __eou__ Well, I didn't clean the house and I didn't study. I stayed in bed and watched TV. __eou__ That sounds like fun, but did you exercise? __eou__ Sort of. I played golf on my computer! __eou__
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend. __eou__ What's the route? __eou__ From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank. __eou__ If only I could join it! __eou__
Excuse me. I'm afraid you're in my seat. You've moved my books. __eou__ Oh, dear. __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here. __eou__ Oh, well, I looked around. There wasn't any other space. I waited a while and nobody came. I'm sorry if I've taken your place. __eou__
What's the life expectancy in your country? __eou__ I'm not sure, but probably about 75 years. How about in your country? __eou__ About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world. __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly. __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday. __eou__ Did she? That's great. However, if we have too many children, that will have a bad effect on the enviroment. __eou__ How's your son these days? __eou__ Oh, he's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays. __eou__ He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24. that's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., or even in your early thirties if you have a good career. __eou__ Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, but not just yet. __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country? __eou__ Yes, there is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don't often succeed. __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom. __eou__ It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, they might go wild. __eou__
I'm going to Japan this year on vacation. __eou__ Have you ever been to America? __eou__ No, but I'd really like to. __eou__ You'd like it. __eou__
Hey, Mark, long time no see. __eou__ Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been? __eou__ Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand. __eou__ Really? How was it? __eou__ Fantastic! I didn't want to come back. __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful. __eou__ They are. And not only that the people are friendly, but also the food is delicious, not to mention cheap. __eou__ I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok? __eou__ Not much. I've got enough city life in Beijing. __eou__ I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself. __eou__ Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime? __eou__ Yeah, it sure would. __eou__
Could I see the manager please? I have a complaint to make. __eou__ Yes, I'm the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in? __eou__ Which room are you in? __eou__ 1808. The toilet doesn't work properly, the water doesn't run in the shower. __eou__ I'm awfully sorry to hear that. I'll turn to it right away. __eou__
Congratulations, Vivian. You won the grand prize, again. __eou__ Isn't it just great! I just knew I'd win! __eou__ You did? How? Did you wear red underwear again this year? __eou__ Not only that! __eou__ Tell me! Tell me! What's your secret?! __eou__ OK, OK. I'll whisper it to you, but you have to promise not to tell anyone! __eou__ What?! You did that??!!! __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening. Will you join us. __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business. __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month, how do you feel about the job? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired. __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you'll get used to this busy job. __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful! __eou__ You know the phrase, the survival the fittest. We have no choices. __eou__ That's right, I have to work hard. __eou__
The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you? __eou__ Sorry, I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right? __eou__ Certainly. __eou__
Excuse me, is this seat taken? __eou__ No, please feel free. __eou__ Thanks a lot. __eou__ Do you work in Shanghai? __eou__ Yes I do. How about you? __eou__ No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, and much more exciting! There's so much to see here. __eou__ You can say that again! It's much more modern than people imagine. Where are you from? __eou__ Um, well let's see... I'm from Kansas originally. A much quieter and more peaceful place than here, that's for sure! __eou__ Uh huh... __eou__
Look at this headline, Soo Mi. __eou__ Wow! So many people in the United States get divorced! __eou__ Is it the same in Korea? __eou__ I don't think so. In Korea some marriages break up, but most couples stay together. __eou__ Do people get married young? __eou__ Not really. Very few people get married beforethe age of 20. __eou__ Hmm. Do women usually work after they get married? __eou__ No, a lot of women stay home and take care of their families. But some work. __eou__
Boy! What a beauty! I fall in love with her at the first sight. __eou__ The beauty under the tree? __eou__ Of course.No girl is more charming. __eou__ She is a young man! __eou__
Excuse me.Where do I register? __eou__ Oh, over there in Pacific Pavilion. __eou__ Is that the large, white building? __eou__ Yeah, that's it. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__
How was your education going on in Australia? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer. __eou__ Where are you going to work then, in Australia or back in China? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation. __eou__ Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad. __eou__ Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment. __eou__ Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country. __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies, Tom? __eou__ Oh, yes. I love playing badminton, table tennis and computer games. And playing the games has become my favorite. __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers. And they don't care about their own health at all. How about you? __eou__ I'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, but I think it's stimulating. __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence, will you? __eou__ Once in a while. __eou__ It's no good. And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time. You might as well do something healthy and meaningful. __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again. __eou__
What's the plot of your new movie? __eou__ It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, but there's very little evidence. It's a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director. __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you? __eou__ Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think. __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie? __eou__ I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future. __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview. __eou__ My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet? __eou__ Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star. __eou__
Who's that old lady trimming the trees? __eou__ She's my grandma. __eou__ She's looks very healthy.How old is she? __eou__ 92. __eou__
Mom. My legs are killing me. __eou__ Hold on. We will be successful right away. __eou__
Oh, man. I had the best supper last night. My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce. Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts. Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger! Mmm! Mmm! It's almost lunchtime. I would die for a plate of stir fry right now! __eou__ Well, you can keep the vegetables, I'll take the meat. The stir fry my wife made was really hearty, with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion... __eou__ What? You call that a stir fry? More meat than vegetables? That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry. What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap! __eou__
What did you say? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk? __eou__ Well, I feel a little tired. __eou__ Come on! A little labor, much health. __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter. __eou__ Don't take too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather. __eou__ I won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park? __eou__ I Believe I will. Look for me near the lake. __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did! He's insane! Do you think we should call the police? __eou__ Don't worry about it, I'll call my friend and have him take care of it. I can't believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job! __eou__ I know! Well... he said I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing. I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose... __eou__ Don't apologize! From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.And now that I'm with you again, I'm... I'm just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, my soul mate. What can I do? __eou__ Just hold me... I'll always be here for you, no matter what. And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, steven. __eou__ I'm so happy to hear that! I knew we belong together. I love you so much. __eou__
Zina, can I talk to you about something personal? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long. __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much. That I spend more time with you than with him. __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back. And I said, fine, I won't. __eou__ So what's the problem? __eou__
Mary, how was your date with john? __eou__ it's ok. It seems we have a lot in common. __eou__ oh, really. That is great news. What does he look like? __eou__ he is tall and slim, fair-haired. __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor. __eou__ oh, it's love at first sight. When will you see each other again? __eou__ he didn't say, but he said he would call me. __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much! __eou__ oh, steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call? __eou__ come on, Mary, you're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry. __eou__ thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging. __eou__ that's what friends are for. __eou__
Hi, Francis, how was your business trip? __eou__ It was a nightmare. __eou__ What's up? __eou__ Actually, the business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year. __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful, why do you call it still a nightmare then? __eou__ Well, the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout. __eou__ This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call. __eou__ Take it easy, all sufferings have their reward. __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong? __eou__ Yes, The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet. So I'd better not risk it. __eou__ Maybe it's a good things. If you don't have to go to Hong Kong, you can take a break and take things easy for a while. __eou__ You are right. Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise. Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit. __eou__ That's a good idea. Let's see if we can get more people in this plan. There isn't much business these days anyway, so I think many people will be interested. __eou__
Which pair of jeans do you like best? __eou__ I really like the straight legs. __eou__ But they aren't very fashionable. What about these? __eou__ I don't like the way they sag down. I feel like I have plumber butt in them. __eou__ That's the style! You just wear boxers. __eou__ What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug? What then? __eou__ You're so old fashioned! Nobody is going to pull down your pants! __eou__ If you ask me, it's a walking invitation! __eou__
Hi, Charles. What's the matter? __eou__ Oh!! My car isn't working. I'm waiting for a tow-truck. __eou__ Do you have a ride home? __eou__ Yes, my wife is coming to get me. __eou__ That's good. Do you live near here? __eou__ No, we live in the suburbs. What about you? __eou__ I live downtown, with my parents. __eou__ Do you have a car? __eou__ I don't need a car. I walk to work. __eou__ You're lucky! __eou__
Happy anniversary, sweetheart! __eou__ Yes. to our first anniversary and many more to come. Cheers! __eou__ I'll drink to that. Thanks for making this a night worth remembering. __eou__ Well, it's a special day. They say if you survive the first year, the rest is smooth sailing. __eou__ That's good to know. Oh, listen! The band's playing our song. __eou__ I requested it. What do you say? Do you have your dancing shoes on? __eou__ Always. __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends, Mum. __eou__ How about a party at home? That way we can get together and celebrate it. __eou__ OK, Mum. I'll invite my friends home. __eou__
How about seconds, Victor? __eou__ No.thanks. I'm full. __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight? __eou__ I'd love to. __eou__ Let's say about 6:00? __eou__ That's OK with me. __eou__
Cigarette? __eou__ Oh, uh... Thanks. Henry, do you have a light? __eou__ Sorry, here. __eou__ Thanks. Lovely day. Pity I'm on duty. __eou__ I'll stand in with you if you like. I'Ve got nothing else to do. __eou__ Oh, no. I couldn't possibly. __eou__
Hi Rose, what are you busy with right now? __eou__ Hi Jack, I'm working on these documents. The manager wants them for half an hour. __eou__ Well, Rose. __eou__ Is there something any need? __eou__ Are your free this weekend? __eou__ Yes, I have nothing to do. __eou__ Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend? __eou__ I beg your pardon? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat. __eou__ Really? well, ok, you're welcome. __eou__ Is 5 PM. Saturday a good time for you? __eou__ Hmm, how about seven? I can treat you to dinner. __eou__ Sure, that would be great. I'll bring the wine. __eou__ OK. Then I'll be expecting you. __eou__ I'll be there on time. __eou__
How do you shoot pool? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table, 7 solid colored, 7 striped colored, a black 8 ball, and the white ball. __eou__ And? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue. The white ball hits the colored balls. And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets. __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one? __eou__ At the beginning, it does not matter, but once someone gets one ball in, it is set. __eou__ Can I get the black ball in? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets. __eou__ Let's go and try now! __eou__
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight? __eou__ I'd enjoy that. __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00. __eou__ OK. I'll see you then. __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me! __eou__ Me, too, I can't stop scratching. They are everywhere! Sneaky little jerks. __eou__ Do you have any bug spray? __eou__ No, I forgot to buy some. __eou__ Then we'll have to put up with it. __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep. __eou__ That's without a doubt, the best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it! __eou__ Run! They are thirsty for more! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV, will you? Why don't you just sit and watch? __eou__ I've tried, but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program. __eou__ Then stay away. No one is keeping you from doing that. __eou__ Don't be so irritable. I just don't understand the program, that's all. __eou__ All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram. __eou__ Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, if that's what you want. __eou__ That's exactly what I want, thank you. __eou__
Okay, can I ask you something direct? __eou__ Ha! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush. __eou__ Fair enough. Give it to me straight. Did she bully you into this? __eou__ No, seriously... I really want this. __eou__ I tell ya, when I got the invite, it really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180. __eou__ I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down. __eou__ I guess so. __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another. She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay. __eou__ It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do. __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more? __eou__ It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment. __eou__ What time is the right moment? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love. We prefer natural love. The most important thing is to be happy. Love will find us later. That is what we say. __eou__
Please excuse me, but I really have to be going. __eou__ Yes, of course.It was nice to see you. __eou__ It was nice to see you, too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins. __eou__
Excuse me. Is this seat taken? __eou__ I'm afraid so. __eou__
What do you think of the coming match? __eou__ Winning is a piece of cake to me. __eou__ You are bragging again. __eou__
What would you reckon the taxing increases? __eou__ Well, the state will benefit a lot, I suppose. __eou__ But what do most people think about it? __eou__ Ah, it's hard to say. __eou__
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night? __eou__ of course. Is the dinner still on? __eou__ yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place. __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice. __eou__ that's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark. __eou__ it can't be that bad. __eou__ I wish it wasn't, but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here. __eou__ really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime. __eou__ do me a favor, and take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better. __eou__ ok, we will. How do you get around in the evenings? __eou__ when I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen  just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation. __eou__ has anything else happened to you? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me, but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close. __eou__ well, we'll be careful. Thanks for letting me know. __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not. __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her. __eou__ He's a chicken guy. __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit. __eou__ Yeah. Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian. She's almost driving Li Na crazy. __eou__ If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that. __eou__ She is as meek as a lamb. She never goes against anyone or anything. She's as good as gold, you know? __eou__
Where is John? I can't find him anywhere. __eou__ Haven't you heard that he is in prison? __eou__ What? Beg your pardon. __eou__ John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing. __eou__ I just cann't believe my ears! __eou__
What do you need? __eou__ I need to use the Internet. __eou__ You have your library card, right? __eou__ Yes, I do. __eou__ There is a wait right now to use the computers. __eou__ That's fine. __eou__ Would you please write your name on this list? __eou__ Then what? __eou__ I will call you when a computer is free. __eou__ How do I log on to the computer? __eou__ Use the number on the back of your library card. __eou__ Thanks. I'll be sitting over there. __eou__
What a nice tie you are wearing! __eou__ Thank you.But does it really look all right? __eou__ Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly. __eou__ Then does it go well with my sweater? __eou__ Yes.You look very smart today. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__
What do you make of the case? __eou__ If you ask me, I don't think it's guilty. __eou__ What do you mean by saying so? __eou__ I mean it's not his fault. __eou__ Oh, yeah? __eou__ Yes. Don't you think he should be pitied rather than accused? __eou__
Happy Mother's Day, Mom! __eou__ Thanks! These are beautiful. You shouldn't have! __eou__ Of course I should have! You certainly deserve them! You put up with all of us. __eou__ I forgot what I put up with. In that case, I do deserve these flowers. __eou__
I have a real problem when I meet people. __eou__ What is it? Maybe I can help. __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to. Can you tell me something about it? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands? __eou__ Oh yes. Men, women, and children shake hands all the time. __eou__ It's very simple. Men shake hands, women and children don't. __eou__ But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, they shake hands too. __eou__ Well, a good rule to follow is, for men you hold out your hand, for women and children, you wait and see what they do. __eou__ That sounds easy enough. __eou__ Sure. Once you get the hang of it, it's a piece of cake! It's nothing to worry about. __eou__
Sam, I am so sorry. It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it. __eou__ Don't worry about it. I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well. __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it. We did try to phone you, but you and Jane must have gone out. __eou__ Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us. __eou__ Oh, yes, I know the one. How was the food? __eou__ The food was excellent, but Jane ordered a birthday cake, which they forgot about. So as you can see, you were not the only one. __eou__ Oh, no. __eou__ Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, but still... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do. __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while. __eou__ Great. I have also been thinking of getting one. Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret? My birthday is not that far away. __eou__ I can try, but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately. __eou__
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at. __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them. __eou__ After you. __eou__
When do you usually go to the movies? __eou__ I usually go in my free time on the weekends. How about you? __eou__ The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends. I like to go to the movies during the week. __eou__ That's true. And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well. __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying. __eou__ All right. But what was the trouble? __eou__ My car run out of petrol. __eou__
I can't believe Mr. Fro didn't buy it. Who does that guy think he is anyway? Bill Gates? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked. __eou__ Time to order. Balista, today I want a skinny triple latte. __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight? __eou__ I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat? __eou__ No, Jess, chill out! __eou__
Come on, Tara. Let's go up to the window and buy two tickets. The movie is starting in a few minutes. __eou__ We can't break into the line. Don't be so impatient. We'll be at the front of the line soon. __eou__ Two tickets, please. How much are they? __eou__ Oh no, Ari. I didn't mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let's go Dutch. I'll pay my own way. I insist. __eou__ I'm looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning's newspaper. __eou__ Me, too. It will be great to see something light and funny for a change. I'm tired of heavy drama. __eou__ Are these seats okay? __eou__ They're fine, but I can't watch a movie without popcorn. __eou__
Do you often buy magazines? __eou__ I buy a computer magazine every month. It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments. __eou__ Why don't you find the information on the internet instead? __eou__ Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes. __eou__ Do you have an online edition of that magazine? __eou__ Yes, they do. But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription. __eou__ Do you have a subscription? __eou__ Yes, I do. The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month. Do you every buy magazines? __eou__ I only buy them if they look particularly interesting. I don't buy any regularly. __eou__
Mumm. Those burgers smell great. It's perfect day for a barbecue. __eou__ It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way. __eou__ Oh, hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you. __eou__ I'm sorry. What's your name again? __eou__ Barbara. But please, just call me Barb. __eou__ So Barb... what do you do? __eou__ I'm studying medicine. __eou__ Really? Where? __eou__ At Harvard. What about you? __eou__ I'm an engineer at IBM. __eou__ Oh, are you? That sounds interesting. __eou__ Yeah. I like it. Hey, it looks like the food is ready. __eou__ Good. I'm starving. __eou__
Wow! I can't believe I'm standing here! __eou__ What are you so excited about? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art! __eou__ What's the big deal? It's just a picture of some woman. __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books, but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person. __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better. __eou__ Maybe so, but do you have any idea how much this one is worth? __eou__ No, how much is it worth? __eou__ About 80 million dollars. __eou__ Whoa. __eou__
hey, Maris, are you a part-timer? __eou__ part-timer? Is that a new buzzword? __eou__ oh, it's pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you? __eou__ sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender. __eou__ cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar! __eou__ yeah, but I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset. __eou__ that's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job? __eou__ of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world. __eou__ you mean you got working experience, right? __eou__ not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life. __eou__ it must be very demanding. __eou__ sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, it's easy to figure out. __eou__ really? It sounds interesting. __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around. __eou__ great. I'm looking forward to it. __eou__
Have you seen that house? __eou__ Yes, it looks interesting. __eou__ You're right. I love it very much. __eou__ It must be old. __eou__ At least more than 100 years old. __eou__ Let's enter it! __eou__ I can't open the door. __eou__ It must be locked. __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office. __eou__ She can't answer you. __eou__ She must be deaf. __eou__ It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened? __eou__ Frightened? You must be joking. __eou__
Have you got any hobbies? __eou__ Yes. I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards. __eou__ Which is easier to learn? __eou__ Both, but the rules of playing cards vary in different places. __eou__
Jim, how was your weekend? __eou__ I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there. __eou__ That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you go swimming, too? __eou__ Sure. I think it's a fantastic place to go. __eou__ I couldn't agree more. That's an ideal place for a vacation. __eou__ It sure is. __eou__ I can't wait to go there myself. __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination. __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard. __eou__ You should change your attitude, or you will not pass the course. __eou__ Maybe you're right. I have been too lazy lately. __eou__
It is high time you have a talk with him. That may help clear the mists. __eou__ I did, but he gives me a runaround. __eou__ If I were you, I would put the whole matter on the table. __eou__ But he was trying to beat about the bush. And my talk with him was fruitless. __eou__
What is the correct time, please? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven. __eou__ When will the lecture begin? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp. __eou__
Should I ask Sara to the party? __eou__ I would if I were you. __eou__
If he promised to help you, I'm sure he will help. He's a man of his word. __eou__ You said it. I always count on him when I need his help. __eou__ Last year he helped me out of trouble, too. __eou__
We're having a sixties party next week. Do you want to come? __eou__ What is a sixties party? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties. __eou__ That sounds like fun. But where can I get clothes that old? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something. __eou__ Good idea. Can I bring some music from that period too? __eou__ That will be great! Do you have LPs or Cds? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player! __eou__
I want to improve my handwriting, and I've practiced it for several weeks, but nothing happened. You see, my handwriting is still bad. __eou__ Oh, come on. You know it's a long process, you have to be patient. __eou__ I know it, but I don't know when I can make it better. __eou__ A, whatever you do, the most important is perseverance. So you have to hang on there, the longer, the better. Then some day, you will find you've already made a lot of progress. __eou__ Yeah, you are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day. __eou__ Yeah! Where there is a will, there is a way. __eou__
I'm so excited, mother. Oh, a new baby! __eou__ My first grandchild. __eou__ And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, mum. He does. __eou__ Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, he's got Richard's eyes though. __eou__ Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does. __eou__ Well, children usually resemble their parents. __eou__ It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is. __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents. __eou__ You're right. __eou__
The music has started. __eou__ How do you like this waltz? __eou__ It's very nice. __eou__ May I ask you for a dance? __eou__ Certainly. __eou__ You are doing the waltz wonderfully well. __eou__ Thanks. I'm glad you say so. Oh, the music has stopped. __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish? __eou__ Oh, we never speak Spanish in class! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English. __eou__ I suppose she's right. Does she speak English very slowly? __eou__ Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said. __eou__ It must be interesting to study English. __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good. __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them. __eou__
Doris, I'm glad you're home. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do! __eou__ What is it? What happened? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me. __eou__ No, it can't be. Really? Who? __eou__ I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring.He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop. __eou__ What did you do? __eou__ I didn't do anything. Finally, he left.But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too. __eou__ Did he leave when you left? __eou__ Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me. __eou__ What did you do? __eou__ He followed me all the way home! __eou__ That's about five blocks. And around corners too.So he was definitely following you. __eou__ Yes, he was. I'm not imagining it.Finally, just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious.What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police? __eou__ Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again, then maybe you should call. __eou__ Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything. __eou__ I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is. __eou__ Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time, and if he follows you again, then I think we should go to the police.But for now, just try not to worry. __eou__ Alright. And I won't go to that cafe for awhile. __eou__
Han Maimed, What's your plan for the weekend? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It's better to get to know it. What about you? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays. __eou__ Oh, my God! John, I didn't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory. __eou__ Come on, Han Maimed, don't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion. __eou__ But I'm really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they? __eou__ Yes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world. __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before, but I don't understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist? __eou__ That's a little complicated. You'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion. __eou__ Really? __eou__ Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England. __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans. __eou__ How come? I mean why most of them were religious people? __eou__ That's because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries. __eou__ So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England? __eou__ Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College. __eou__ Why did they want to found a college? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well. __eou__ Oh, I see. __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name. __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University? __eou__ In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman. __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion. __eou__ Therefore, it's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard. __eou__ Wow, I didn't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S. __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard. __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related. __eou__ That's right. I have a lot to learn from you. __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time. __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation. Could you explain it? __eou__ Sorry, I really can't do that. There's little time left for us. __eou__ I can't accept your excuse. It's five o'clock. __eou__ But I have an appointment with Ann. __eou__ Ok, sounds good. But I think it's your trick. __eou__
What do you do in summer? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? __eou__ I don't often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. __eou__ What do you do in winter? __eou__ Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter. __eou__ I think most people do. I like wearing nice, colorful clothes in summer-you know, a nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter. __eou__ Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze! __eou__ Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year? __eou__ Thanks to global warming, it could be hotter than ever! __eou__
I will never forget Linda. After all, she was my first lover. __eou__ I think you'll lay it to rest with the time flying. __eou__ I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don't want to forget. __eou__ But I think time can change everything. __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? __eou__ Pardon? __eou__ What university would you enter? __eou__ University? Why? You asked me last year. __eou__ Oh, I forget.Sorry. __eou__ I went to Harvard University. __eou__ Did you? And what course did you take there? __eou__ God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you? __eou__ I've not known.Perhaps, I've got a bad memory. __eou__ I did a B. A. in economics.Remember? __eou__ Terrific! B. A., again and again-B. A. __eou__
I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion. __eou__ Fun for you! Do you get to do anything you want? __eou__ Yep. And I should start planning now. __eou__ Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions? __eou__ Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone. __eou__ How Ay days will the reunion be? __eou__ Usually it's at least five days and four nights. __eou__ This is going to be a major production for you! __eou__
Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia. __eou__ Nice to meet you, Lvan.My name is Alike. I'm from Japan. __eou__ To me English is a difficult language. __eou__ A second language is always difficult. __eou__ True, but English is harder than most.It's a crazy language. __eou__ A crazy language? Why do you say that? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings. __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language. __eou__
What did you think of the film? __eou__ I liked it. I thought it was great. __eou__ Yes, I liked it, too. Did you like the acting? __eou__ Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you? __eou__ Not really. I thought it was disappointing. __eou__ It's a nice cinema, isn't it? __eou__ Do you think so? I don't like it very much. I found it rather uncomfortable. __eou__
What's up? You don't look too good. __eou__ Yeah, my head hurts, that's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer! __eou__ I liked physics. It's all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. __eou__ Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe. __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me. __eou__ It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. __eou__ Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says. __eou__ Math, sheath. What's the evidence? __eou__ There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH! __eou__ Anyway, it's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that? __eou__ Dude, don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn't you? __eou__
Which film shall we see? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let's do something different.Would you like to go to a concert? __eou__ Yes, I'd love to.Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven.It's on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there? __eou__ Fine! Do you want anything to eat now? __eou__ No, I'm not hungry. __eou__ Well, let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, but it's fun. __eou__
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill. You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich. I'm thinking about buying stocks. It can be a good investment if I can manage well. What do you say? __eou__ I partly agree with you. Buying stocks is not difficult, but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult. Even professionals don't find it easy, so be careful. Anyway, people like us need help with investing. Why not do some online research? There are data, reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest. In addition, you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts. __eou__ Wow, you sound very professional. __eou__ I just watched the investment TV program last weekend. It has become a very hot topic these days. Actually I am not even a beginner. __eou__
Can I borrow your suit? __eou__ That's out of the question. __eou__
Bill, how can you hear so happy today? __eou__ Aha. I've read of my roommate. I made a move today. __eou__ Really? What was the matter? __eou__ You knew Brain Locker? __eou__ Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like? __eou__ Well, he's thin and tall. He has brown hair, a holt nose, green eyes and wearing glasses. __eou__ Mm. I've seen him a couple of times, I think. __eou__
Where are you from? __eou__ I'm from Guangzhou. __eou__ Where in China is Guangzhou? __eou__ It's in the South of China. __eou__
Well, I must be off now. I have an appointment at six. __eou__ In that case, I won't keep you any longer. Drop in anytime. __eou__ Ok, Goodbye. __eou__ See you later. __eou__
Hey! How was your first day of class? I'm in level two and I'm loving my class this semester! It's great being in a class of international students! __eou__ Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. __eou__ That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, __eou__ That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and o __eou__ Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture. __eou__ I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes. __eou__ Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice. __eou__ I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese. __eou__ Well, there is that, yes. __eou__
Hey, I'm hungry. How about you? __eou__ Yeah, I can really go for some Chinese food right now. __eou__ That's a great idea. Let's go to a Chinese restaurant. __eou__ I know one. Let's go. __eou__
Good morning, Miss Li. __eou__ Morning, Mike. __eou__ I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday. __eou__ I'Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave. How do you feel today? __eou__ I feel much better now. __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday? __eou__ I'Ve already got it. Thanks. __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class. Could you preview it? __eou__ I will. __eou__
Do you like flowers? __eou__ Of course, I like. __eou__ What's your favorite flower? __eou__ Forsythia. It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival. __eou__ Spring is a lively season. __eou__ Yes. How about you? __eou__ I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter. __eou__ You have a perfect taste! __eou__ It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms. __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people. __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever. __eou__ Well, it's snowing. Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing. __eou__
What is the weather like today? __eou__ It stops snowing, but there's a bit wind. __eou__ And the streets are covered with ice. Do you know what the temperature is today? __eou__ I missed today's weather for cast in the radio __eou__ It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, but do hate when it get slippery. __eou__ The ice is soon be thick for skating. I'm so fine to want a sport __eou__ That's fine. let's go skating together tomorrow. __eou__
What kind of music do you like listening to? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don't you? __eou__ Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work. __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music. __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. __eou__ Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. __eou__ Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework. __eou__ I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power. __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them. __eou__ That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier. __eou__ That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character. __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street. __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu. Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish. __eou__ That's right. You don't drink coffee, do you? __eou__ No, so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop. __eou__ What kind of things would you like to see on the menu? __eou__ Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least. __eou__ That shouldn't be too difficult. Since this is a small neighborhood, maybe they will take this suggestion. __eou__ Let's try it! __eou__
Darling, I have news for you. Bobby and his wife, Evelyn, are going to have a baby soon. __eou__ Really? I thought his wife couldn't have a baby. __eou__ Actually they're expecting the baby to come on my birthday. __eou__ Oh, what a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own. __eou__ In fact, they're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese. __eou__ Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl? __eou__ It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now. __eou__ Oh! You mean she doesn't have to work now? It's hard for young parents not to overreact, isn't it? __eou__
Well, I am a regular member of this club. __eou__ Do you have to pay to join? __eou__ Yes, membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars. __eou__ Wow, that much? Don't they have any public courses? __eou__ Very few, unfortunately. __eou__ How was your game today? __eou__ Extremely good. I shot a 78, including 5 birdies! __eou__ Congratulations! What's your normal handicap? __eou__ Ten. How did your game go? __eou__ My drives were terrible today. I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps. __eou__ Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again. __eou__
The concert was really great. __eou__ I agree. __eou__ The singing group used to be very popular. __eou__ I can't believe they would play so good. __eou__
I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night. Would you like to go? __eou__ Thanks. I'd love to. What time is the show? __eou__ It's at 8: 00. __eou__ That sounds great. So, do you want to have dinner at 6:00? __eou__ Uh, I'd like to, but I have to work late. __eou__ Oh, that's OK. Let's just meet at the theater before the show, around 7:30. __eou__ That sounds fine. __eou__
Is the Chinese team taking the lead? __eou__ No, it's the Japanese team. __eou__ Japanese teams always play a dark horse. __eou__ Well, their team work is well worth learning. __eou__
Do you mind if I ask your friend out? __eou__ Of course, but we aren't going out, we're just friends. __eou__ Okay, that's good. __eou__ Do you want me to put in a good word for you? __eou__
Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone. __eou__ I know only too well what that's like. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ I was very sad when I was laid off last year. __eou__
Hi, Is that David? __eou__ Hi, Jenny. It's David here. __eou__ Hey, what's new? __eou__ Not much. My girlfriend just dumped me. __eou__ Sorry to hear that. What happened? __eou__ Well, she told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together. But I thought things were just great. Why did she say this? It's completely out of the blue. __eou__ Hey, that's not the girl with pink hair, is it? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday. __eou__ What? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy. Oh, no, I feel like such a loser. __eou__ Hey, she is not worth it. Forget her. __eou__ But she lied to me. __eou__ Hey, she is not worth it. Anyway, there are plenty more fish in the sea. Listen, let's go for a drink in the town. How about that? __eou__ Ok, then. __eou__ But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face. __eou__ What face? __eou__ The one where you look like your dog just died. You have to get over her and the sooner the better. __eou__ Yeah, I know. You are right. __eou__
This is a nice set of wheels. How much did the dealer charge you for this? __eou__ A lot. I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life, but so what, it's worth it. Come on, get in. Let's take a drive. __eou__ Okay then, let's go fast! Whoa! This thing can really accelerate fast. __eou__ Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly. It can stop quickly. __eou__ Hey, just watch out for cops or you're gonna end up in the slammer. You know you tend to go fast? __eou__ Yes, I know it. I went through my last set of tires fast. I even had three flat tires in two weeks. __eou__ Now watch... some guys probably run a light and hit your car. __eou__ Cut out, would you? __eou__
When's your birthday? __eou__ It's just around the corner. __eou__
Bob is getting on in years. __eou__ Yeah, I'm very worried about his health. __eou__ He looks tired all the time. __eou__ He's working too hard. __eou__
Which church do you attend? __eou__ I am Mormon, so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. __eou__ What's the difference between this and other Churches? __eou__ Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church. __eou__ Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt? __eou__ That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all. __eou__ Do you believe that Mormons have all of it? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Why do you really go to church? __eou__ We gather together to encourage each other, because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church. __eou__
Sorry I was late for the meeting today. I got stuck in traffic. __eou__ That's okay. Better late than never. __eou__
Hello! What are you reading about in the newspaper? __eou__ Hello! I was exhausted some studying, so I decided to read the newspaper to relax. Unfortunately, the news is so depressing. There has been another murder in the city center. I'm shocked that the police haven't caught the killer yet. __eou__ People are starting to get frightened by it. Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder. __eou__ You mean "if" they catch the murderer. I'm scared stiff about going into the city center at night. __eou__ There must have been some good news in the newspaper. I can't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited. __eou__ Well, there was one good piece of news. You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease? __eou__ Yes. Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states. __eou__ Well, they'Ve got the money and she's going tomorrow for treatment. __eou__ I'm so happy for the family! They must be very relieved and excited about that. __eou__ I'm sure they are. Oh, and a local man won the lottery. I'm so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I'm amazed that I haven't even won a small prize yet. It's so unfair! __eou__ Don't be moody! I hope you're not tired, because we'Ve been invited to a party this evening. I know how excited you get about parties. __eou__
Hi! Tom. Want to go to play bowling tonight? __eou__ Sounds good. When and where shall we meet? __eou__ Let me see. How about 6:30 at the gate of the club? __eou__ Fine, see you then. __eou__
Are there many idioms in English? __eou__ There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions. __eou__ Can you give us an example? __eou__ I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information. __eou__ What about the expression goodbye? Is that an idiom? __eou__ That is just a natural, grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages. __eou__ This is interesting, Ms.Parker. __eou__
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class? __eou__ Because Myra was cheating on exams, and she spoke back rudely. __eou__ I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher. I know she was angry, but that's still no excuse for rudeness. __eou__
Do you know where I can park? __eou__ Do you need a spot here or off campus? __eou__ I want a space on campus. __eou__ There's a parking structure for students. __eou__ Where can I find it? __eou__ Go to the western side of the campus, and you'll find it there. __eou__ Is it full? __eou__ When I went up there, it wasn't full at all. __eou__ When was that? __eou__ Sometime this morning. __eou__ Would it be full now? __eou__ I am really not sure. __eou__
Have you heard of the Love Bug? __eou__ Do you mean the'I love you'virus that attacks computers through e-mail? __eou__ Yes. It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world. People say it will break out again om Valentines'Day this year. __eou__ This is terrible. Why do hackers play such a dirty trick? __eou__ Hackers are smart, and they want people to know about it. __eou__ So they create viruses to tell people they are smart? That's really sick. __eou__
I am confused by what he said. __eou__ Why do you say that? __eou__ I don't know what he wants to do. Does he want help me or just scold me? __eou__ Think a little. I think he means well at the bottom of his heart. __eou__
Where are you going? __eou__ I'm going to the hospital. __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident. __eou__ That's too bad. How are things now? __eou__ His life is hanging by a thread, and he is under an emergency treatment. __eou__
Want to meet for lunch this Saturday? __eou__ Sorry, I can't.

I help plan activities. __eou__ Oh, yeah? __eou__ Yes, it's exciting. This month we are doing crossword puzzles. __eou__
Are the children all grown up now, Rose? __eou__ Oh, yes. Laura's the oldest. She's a computer programmer. __eou__ Oh, very interesting. And what about Rita?

Mostly to England and France. __eou__

Where's your better half? __eou__ She's at home. __eou__
Look, there are some words on the fish. __eou__ I know that they are auspicious fish. It's quite popular nowadays. __eou__ For God's sake! It's too bloody. How can people be so cruel? __eou__ Not at all. I think the tattoos are so cool and chic. __eou__ You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people. __eou__ Honey, it's not so serious. It's just an animal. __eou__ Just an animal? But it has life too. If you want a tattoo, get one. It's your choice because you want it. But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one? __eou__ OK, I understand, but what else could we do? __eou__

I saw an interesting program on TV last night. It was about elderly people. __eou__ And what did the program say? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier. __eou__ I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea. __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress. __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, and he lifts weights every day. __eou__
Did you see the information on sales for last year? The sales review was made at our last board meeting. There's a great news for our shareholders. __eou__ Yeah, I went over the figures this morning. We're finally started making money again! __eou__ We've never sold this much before, our growth this year has been phenomenal. We have captured 8 % of the market, up from last year by 120 %. Our strategy is working! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record, but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well. After a two-year slump, we finally back in the black. __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president. He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation. Products are selling like hotcakes. __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution, and partly because of our new marketing strategy. Because of the new advertising campaign, we have become the top sellers in the field. __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts. I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good. __eou__ Let's hope it is! __eou__
What a letdown. I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand. __eou__ It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm. __eou__ Such a thing exists? __eou__ Fortunately, yes. You're blushing! __eou__ Am I? Um... my face gets red when I walk too fast. __eou__ You're embarrassed, aren't you? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy. The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her... __eou__
Did you get any rewards or honors in college? __eou__ Yes, I received the scholarship 3 times on end. __eou__ Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC )? __eou__ Yes, I joined the CPC when I was a freshman __eou__

You know, Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days. __eou__ And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves. __eou__ But you're not to blame for them keeping him there. __eou__ Yeah, what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway? __eou__ I'm not sure, but we can find out.

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that. The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class. __eou__ You've got to be joking! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants, and if she saw Myra cheating, she certainly had the right to say so. __eou__ I agree she had the right to say something, but I feel she should have done it privately. __eou__ You're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that. __eou__
Come on in. I am so glad you are here. We have been expecting you. __eou__ Am I late for the party? Looks everyone is already here. Hope I didn't miss something interesting. __eou__ No, you are just on time. We haven't really started yet. __eou__ Great, here are some flowers for you. I hope you like them.

Want something to drink, tea, coffee, juice or Cola? __eou__ Don't bother. I will help myself. __eou__ Make yourself at home. __eou__ It is such a nice place. __eou__ Well, I don't mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments. Look, they are making photos now of my designed kitchen. __eou__
Steven, would you like to go dance with us tonight? __eou__ John, I am just not in the mood for this. __eou__ You look so upset. What's going on? __eou__ I lost the table tennis game yesterday. __eou__ Oh, what a pity! __eou__ I just don't want to play table tennis any more. __eou__ Is it that bad? It's nothing more than a game. __eou__ My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis. __eou__ Oh, come on! Failure is the mother of success. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed. __eou__ Perhaps you are right. But I still need some time to recover from the failure. __eou__ I understand. __eou__
The band is pretty good. How do you like the music? __eou__ It's very nice. I haven't heard live music in a while. This is fun. __eou__ Well, then, may I invite you for the next dance? __eou__ Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer... __eou__ Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself. __eou__ You're dancing so well. __eou__ You dance beautifully too. __eou__ When did you learn to dance? __eou__ In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance? __eou__ It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz. __eou__ How about tango? __eou__ Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, but I can't do it well. What about you? __eou__ Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot. ( the music has stopped ) __eou__ Thank you for the dance. __eou__ My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink. __eou__ OK. __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution. __eou__ Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, my country is more agricultural and has much less industry. __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, but cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced. __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it. __eou__ I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem? __eou__
I just had a terrible week. __eou__ What a shame! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm. __eou__ That's too bad. __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy. __eou__ What a pity! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away. __eou__ Ho, no! __eou__
I'm so excited, mother. Oh, a new baby! __eou__ My first grandchild. __eou__ And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, mum. He does. __eou__ Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, he's got Richard's eyes though. __eou__ Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does. __eou__ Well, children usually resemble their parents. __eou__ It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is. __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents. __eou__ You're right. __eou__
When do you go to bed usually? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six. __eou__ That's helpful for your health. __eou__ Sure. __eou__
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld? __eou__ When I was young, my parents took me to the one in California. I always forget which  is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland, so you must have been to Disneyland. __eou__ That's right. Why do you ask? __eou__ Well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon. __eou__ When are getting married? __eou__ Some time next year. We haven't set the date yet. __eou__ Congratulations! I had no idea. __eou__ Thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks? __eou__ For the most part, yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, though. __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, you'll have a good time. __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark? __eou__ Even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun. __eou__ Thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight. __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea. Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it! __eou__
Can you speak French? __eou__ Yes, I can, but not very well. __eou__ Can you understand your Spanish teacher? __eou__ More or less. How well do you understand Mr. Wang, your Chinese teacher? __eou__ About 40 percent, if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast, I can only catch a word here and there. But Mr. Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help, my Chinese is getting better and better e __eou__
you look better today. How did your test go? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday. __eou__ did you pass? __eou__ I not only passed my test, but I aced it! I'm so happy! __eou__ you should be. You worked really hard last night preparing for it. __eou__ thanks for helping me with it. If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best, I wouldn't have ever been able to pass. __eou__ you don't have to thank me. It's just a part of my job as your counsellor. __eou__ did you always do well at school? __eou__ no, in fact, I was terrible at taking exams. __eou__ really? __eou__ sure, but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot. When are your final exams? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months. __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead. __eou__ do you think that's a good idea? __eou__ no, I think I should study a little bit at a time, starting a few weeks before the exam. __eou__ that sounds like a good idea. What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant. __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year! __eou__
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance? __eou__ Oh, you don't ask much, do you? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition. __eou__ I'll tell you what. Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones. __eou__ That sounds fair. That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us. __eou__ Not as fun though. A live band is way more exciting! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money. We already checked into it. __eou__ Let me know with your next dance. I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity. __eou__
Do you want to go to the beach tonight? __eou__ Sure, which beach are we going to? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach. __eou__ I like Santa Monica. __eou__ The water there looks so dirty. __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica. __eou__ I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night. __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice? __eou__ It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better. __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu? __eou__ If that's okay with you. __eou__ Sure, let's go to Malibu. __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today. Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action, but I doubt it'll happen before it's too late. __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere. There's lots of clean, modern technology, but companies in developed countries say it's expensive. Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection. __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests. We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life. __eou__ In other parts of the world, especially in Africa, there is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow enough food. __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people. __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment. __eou__ I think I'd like to do that. I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies. __eou__
Kathy! How are you? It's been ages! What are you doing these days? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant. I'm also head chef. __eou__ You're kidding! You've always hated cooking! __eou__ Well, I used to hate cooking, but now I love it. __eou__ When did you change your mind? __eou__ After I tried French food. Before that, I used to cook really boring things for my family. __eou__ I still can't believe it! So, did you go to cooking school or something? __eou__ Yeah. I went to California to study. __eou__ Really? How long did you stay there? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90. __eou__ And what did you do after that? __eou__ Then I came back here. I worked for about three years to get some experience. __eou__
Susan, I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend. __eou__ A house warming party? __eou__ Yes, Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn. __eou__ Congratulations! That's wonderful. I bet both of you are quite happy. __eou__ Well, we have always dreamed of owning our own home, but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive. __eou__ I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, far from the city. __eou__ That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby. __eou__ I agree. That's why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine, or Wisconsin. __eou__
What can I do for you? __eou__ I am trying to find this book. __eou__ What's the problem? __eou__ It doesn't seem like this library has it. __eou__ Have you checked the computer? __eou__ I have already. __eou__ What did it say? __eou__ It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there. __eou__ I can always borrow the book from another library. __eou__ You can do that? __eou__ I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in. __eou__ That's fantastic. Thank you. __eou__
ABC Rent-a-Car. May I help you? __eou__ I would like to rent a car. What kind of car do you have? __eou__ We have Volkswagen, Pinto, Plymouth and Datsun. __eou__ What is the rate? __eou__ Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto and Datsun, and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth. __eou__ How about mileage and gas? __eou__ There is no charge for mileage. And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included. __eou__ OK. I'll try a Pinto. I want to rent a car for one week. __eou__ All right, sir. May I have your driver's license? __eou__ Here you are. __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight? __eou__ Sure, I'd love to. __eou__
Which film shall we see? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let's do something different.Would you like to go to a concert? __eou__ Yes, I'd love to.Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven.It's on the Festival Hall. __eou__ Fine! Do you want anything to eat now? __eou__ No, I'm not hungry. __eou__ Well, let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, but it's fun. __eou__
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, that's true. __eou__ How long is the holiday? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days. __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival? __eou__ Yes, dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example, people eat chicken for good luck. __eou__ That's interesting. I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, it's really wonderful! __eou__ Oh, great! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing. __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time. __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus. __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do. __eou__ But a taxi costs too much. __eou__ That's true. __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible. My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius, and I've got a headache and a runny nose. __eou__ do you have any other symptoms? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache. Is my face still swollen? __eou__ just a little. Has your toothache gone now? __eou__ yes, for the most part. It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments, anyway. __eou__ how about your tongue? Does it still hurt? __eou__ no, the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away. I think it's already healed. __eou__ how did you get that burn again? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago. __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately, have you? __eou__ no, but I'm sure I'll get better soon. __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch. __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each. What would you like to drink with them? __eou__ just some water, please. Do you have any ointment for my nose? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much. __eou__ sure, I'll just go and get it now. what would you like to eat? Some soup? __eou__ that sounds good. __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick. I hope it makes you feel better, too. __eou__
I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him. __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know. __eou__ I'm just thinking about that, but the trouble is, I don't know who is well in the know. __eou__ Did you ask his former secretary, Lora? She knows a lot about him. __eou__ Thanks for reminding me. She's the right person to help me. __eou__
What are you two doing in here? __eou__ We heard you weren't feeling well, so we came to check on you. __eou__ I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden, there she was. __eou__ Who, Femi? Yeah, Yi-jun saw her inside. __eou__ All these memories of prom night came back to me. I had to be alone. You remember that night? __eou__ I remember someone spiked my punch. You sat with me in the girl's bathroom... __eou__
You're not looking happy.What's the matter? __eou__ Oh, nothing special. I'm just a bit tired. __eou__ With the job? __eou__ With everything, with everybody, with all this! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday. __eou__ It wasn't always like this, you know. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ Well, I mean.We always do the same thing.There's no variety in our lives. __eou__ You need a holiday.That's what's the matter. __eou__ Certainly, perhaps. __eou__
Oh dear, Miss, you are soaked! Wow, it's really raining heavily outside. __eou__ Yes, it sure is. I had to run here from work! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break. __eou__ Well please, why don't you go ahead of me in line? I'm in no hurry. __eou__ Oh, that's so nice of you! Thank you very much. __eou__ My pleasure Miss. Actually, could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before. __eou__ Sure. Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town! __eou__ Well, thanks for the suggestions. __eou__ Oh, don't mention it. __eou__
Dad, what's the date? __eou__ It's December eighteenth. __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day. __eou__ Yes, I know that. __eou__ So, can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present? __eou__ Sure, a promise is a promise. __eou__
What happen, John? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ Why do you look unhappy? __eou__ I'm rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off. __eou__ Oh, cheer up. He'll understand you. __eou__
This man is your fiance, Dolly? __eou__ Yeah, how do you like him? __eou__ He's handsome. __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest, but sometimes he's a bit conservative. __eou__
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us? __eou__ Don't bother. those are a dime a dozen where we are going. __eou__
Brooke, are you still mad? Is your mom mad? __eou__ No... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd. So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day... __eou__ It will be. And today is, too. I just talked to the airlines... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats? __eou__ No, they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in... __eou__ Hawaii? My dream honeymoon destination? __eou__ You got it! We'll fly there directly from Texas. __eou__ Oh, Jack! That's wonderful! __eou__
The world changes, the family changes too. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child. __eou__ That is called a nuclear family. __eou__ I don't like such a family. __eou__ What kind of family are you like? __eou__ I like a family composed of many people. It includes grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, and children. __eou__ It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well. __eou__ We can live well, I think. __eou__
What was that all about? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion. __eou__ Is she going to be okay? __eou__ She'll be fine. __eou__
Is sailing fun? __eou__ You bet! __eou__
John dates her seven times a week. __eou__ Really? That's a straws in the wind. __eou__ I think so. Maybe he's fallen for her. __eou__ Yeah. They suit each other. A perfect match between a man and a girl. __eou__ Right. __eou__
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down. __eou__ I don't think Joe has done such a thing. Don't believe things in haste. __eou__ Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true. __eou__
Good morning, Loans. __eou__ Good morning, Mr. Smith. __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence. __eou__ Well, thank you, Mr. Smith. But I was just doing my job. __eou__ Yes. And we're proud of you, Loans. __eou__ It's nice of you to say so. __eou__
Which countries have you been to? __eou__ I'Ve been to most of the countries in Europe, several countries in asia-china, Japan, korea, and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada. __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too. __eou__ No, but I'm planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon. I'Ve heard that they are beautiful countries. Which is the most beautiful country you'Ve been to? __eou__ I think I'd say norway. It has many picturesque fjords, waterfalls, and mountains. __eou__ Isn't it really cold there? __eou__ Well, the north of Norway is almost always cold, but further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, so there's snow almost everywhere in winter. __eou__ I'Ve been to other Scandinavian countries, but not to Norway. Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there. __eou__
Alison, would you like to have some more? __eou__ No thanks. I have had enough. __eou__ Actually you haven't have much. __eou__ To tell you the truth, I am on the diet. __eou__ That sounds ridiculous. Why? __eou__ Well, I am gaining weight these days, and I have to watch my calories. __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party, I am so happy you can come. __eou__ Thanks for inviting me. Here is the gift for you. Happy birthday, Francis! Many more happy and healthy years for you! __eou__ Thank you, shall I open it now? __eou__ Yes, please do. __eou__ Wow, a remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you. __eou__ Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself. __eou__ Typical you, always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. The more I appreciate the gift now. __eou__
Did you read the news that'China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December, ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market'? __eou__ No. Does the newspaper say what has caused that? __eou__ Yes. It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics. __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market. __eou__ Right. The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents. __eou__
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life. They have lots of money, so they can buy almost anything they want. They're famous, so everyone loves them. __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives. All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do. They must get sick of it. __eou__ I bet they love it really. Sure, they complain about it, but that just gets them more publicity, doesn't it? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films. __eou__ No way! They want publicity for themselves, so that they get invited to make more films, go to lots of cocktail parties, and even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party. __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt, but they can't because their managers force them to wear clothes they don't like. __eou__ I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, over-ambitious, and over-adored. __eou__ I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves. __eou__ Come on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves  __eou__
Hi, it is a pleasant surprise! __eou__ Yeah, it's been ages! So how have you been? __eou__ Couldn't be better. And you? __eou__ Just as usual, you know. __eou__
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out? __eou__ Cut what out I'm not doing anything. __eou__ The tapping of your pen on your desk. It's driving me crazy. __eou__ Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup! __eou__ I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time? __eou__ You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze? __eou__ Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, it's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are. __eou__ Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down. __eou__ Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So, I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night? __eou__
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful! __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing, you know. __eou__ Yes, I can see. The summer heat is over, and the winter cold is still far away. __eou__ What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice in Washington. __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there? __eou__ No, it isn't. But sometimes it snows a lot in winter. __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there? __eou__ Oh yes! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing? __eou__ There's a lot of rain in summer, but it seldom rains in autumn. __eou__ I feel it's rather dry here. __eou__ That's true. Many people from the south don't like the weather here. __eou__ Are you from the south? __eou__ No, I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing, actually. __eou__ I see.so this is your hometown? __eou__
Mike, come and look at this painting of shrimp! It is so simple yet so vivid! __eou__ Yeah. It is incredible! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi? __eou__ Yes, it is. How do you know that? __eou__ Well, Qi is famous all over the world, isn't he? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting. __eou__ Cool! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, free sketch or claborate-style painting? __eou__ I prefer free sketch, especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings. __eou__ That's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, which is an important part of China's traditional culture. __eou__ I love this art exhibition! __eou__ So do I. Let's go to other areas to see what they have got, shall we? __eou__ OK. __eou__
Lousy weather, isn't it? __eou__ It has stopped snowing, but it's even colder. __eou__ Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves. __eou__ And the streets are covered with snow. __eou__ Do you know what the temperature is today? __eou__ I missed today's weather forecast over the TV. __eou__ It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery. __eou__ The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports. __eou__ That's great. Let's go skating together tomorrow. __eou__
Nick, it's very nice of you to see me off. __eou__ You're welcome. Did you have a good time on this vacation? __eou__ Very well. If I leave I'll miss you. __eou__ Me too. Please write to me as soon as you get Boston. __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number. I'll call you. __eou__ OK, they begin to register. __eou__ It's time I left. __eou__ Have a nice journey! Do give my regards to your parents. __eou__
What are your working hours? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning, two to six in the afternoon. __eou__ Much better than mine. __eou__ What are your hours? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed. Sometimes I do the day shift, sometimes the night shift. __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend? __eou__ For What? __eou__ Well, I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday. __eou__ Well, that sounds like it would be OK. Just be careful. __eou__
Could you tell me what university you went to, Mr. Smith? __eou__ I went to Yale University. __eou__ Did you? And what did you study? __eou__ I have a B. A. in Economics. __eou__ Would you mind telling me how old you are? __eou__ I'm twenty-seven. __eou__ And could you tell me what other jobs you have had? __eou__ Yes, I have worked in a bank for the last years. __eou__ And what was your salary at the bank? __eou__ I got $ 500 a week. __eou__
Hi, Jane. How are you doing this morning? __eou__ I'm all right, thanks. Just a little tired. __eou__ Late night? __eou__ Yeah, I got home around two. __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year, what do you say? __eou__ Fantastic! I enjoy clubbing, especially those clubs with live bands. The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad, full of smoke, and the music is too loud, so conversations are not really possible. Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette. __eou__ How did that happen? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it. If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face. __eou__ Sounds cool! But that is not what a lady should do. People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk. __eou__
What do you do for a living? __eou__ I'm a doctor. __eou__ Really? Do you like it? __eou__ Yes, I do. It's very interesting. What's your job? __eou__ I'm a bus driver. __eou__ Oh, do you enjoy it? __eou__ No, I don't really like it. It's boring. __eou__
what a nice garden! Look at these tulips! __eou__ that would be a good shot. Can you take my picture here, dear? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well. __eou__ all right. Would you please stand closer to the flower bed? Good. Smile. Say "cheese". OK, got you. That's terrific. __eou__ thanks. Could you take one more from this angle? __eou__ no problem. __eou__ now let's have one together. __eou__ do you know how to set the timer? __eou__ let me see... set the timer first and push the button, oh, come here. __eou__ OK, let's have a try. __eou__ cheese... __eou__ did it come out? __eou__ yes, but it's blurred and a little dark. __eou__ never mind. Let's go to the falls and try again. __eou__ Ok, let's go. __eou__
Did you watch television last night, Charles? __eou__ Yes, I did. __eou__ It was a good game, wasn't it? __eou__ Oh, I didn't watch the football match. I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film. __eou__ What a pity. It was quite exciting. Both teams played very well. __eou__ How did it finish? __eou__ It finished in a draw. What was the film like? __eou__ It was quite good. But. I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first. __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it? __eou__ No, she didn't. After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book. __eou__
Hey, Vernassa. why be angry look? __eou__ It's the new neighbor. I hate her guts. __eou__ I've never seen you so worked up. what did she do to you? __eou__ She made another white crack about my clothes. __eou__ Are you sure she was trying to put you down? __eou__ Of course, I am sure. __eou__ You shall go easy on her. she is new here. __eou__ Just how am I supposed to do that? __eou__ You shall just take it in surprise. __eou__ I've tried, but she keeps pushing my buttons. __eou__ Try to pull it together, Vernassa. I am sure things will turn note, ok? __eou__ I am not. she is no picnic. __eou__ Well. if you think I can help, let me know. __eou__ Thanks, Serena. __eou__
I'm forming a music band. __eou__ Do you already know how to play an instrument? __eou__ Uh... Yeah! I'Ve told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band. __eou__ Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band? __eou__ We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass.Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right? __eou__ Yes, I'm a singer. __eou__ Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house. __eou__ Great! Wait here? You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice? __eou__

I'm sorry, dad. But you can't do that. It's for me to decide. __eou__ Oh, I see. You'Ve already decided, have you? Now, you listen to me, you're only 19. __eou__ I didn't say I'd already decided, dad. I said it was for me to decide. There is a difference. __eou__ Oh. So you think you can just do whatever you want, do you? __eou__ I didn't say that either. I was hoping we could discuss the matter together. I want your advice but I don't want you to tell me what to do. I'Ve got to make decisions for myself, dad. __eou__
Hello, Friendship Restaurant. May I help you? __eou__ I'd like to book a table tonight. __eou__ Yes, Sir. For how many people, please? __eou__ Eight. __eou__ What time? __eou__ Eight o'clock tonight, would you please set us in a private room? __eou__ So sorry, we're fully booked in that room.

Hey, Zina. You're here early today. __eou__ Yeah, I'm going to be making phone calls all day. What a blast. __eou__ I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast. I appreciate it. __eou__ Save it, Vince. After I put my first million in the bank, I'll say you're welcome. __eou__ Fair enough.Keep up the good work. __eou__
That is the most beautiful sunset! __eou__ Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute. __eou__ Here is a good place. Let's get out. __eou__ Wow. We don't get to see this in the city! __eou__ Mother Nature is quite an artist. __eou__ Look behind us at the mountains! They're reflecting pink! __eou__ Amazing. The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere! __eou__ Where is our camera? Let's see if we can catch this on film! __eou__
What a nice day! Why don't we go for an outing? __eou__ Sure.Where would you suggest? __eou__ How about going to the suburbs? __eou__ Sounds good. __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? __eou__ Sorry, I thought you knew. __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her. __eou__ Didn't I? __eou__ You know you didn't. __eou__ Well, I'm telling you now. __eou__ Yes, but you might have told me before. __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested. __eou__ You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her? __eou__ Sorry, I didn't think it mattered. __eou__ Oh, you men! You're all the same. __eou__
Hi, Bill. __eou__ Hi, Jim. __eou__ Where is that cool guy, Dick? I haven't seen him for two weeks. __eou__ He's been sick since he came back from Italy. __eou__ Bummer, I'm sorry to hear that, is he better now? __eou__ Yes, Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP. __eou__
Where's Tom this evening? __eou__ He's a little sick under the weather. __eou__ Really! What's the matter with him? __eou__ He has the flu. __eou__ Tell him I was asking about him. __eou__ I will. __eou__
Maybe you should talk to the teacher. __eou__ No, it's no use. __eou__ You never know unless you try. __eou__ I know. She won't change my grade. __eou__
well, I finished my last final today. __eou__ the end of all the hard work for my master's. what a nice feeling to get my degree! __eou__ do you want to attend the convocation? __eou__ certainly. After years of hard work, I wouldn't miss it. By the way, where can I find cap and gown? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them? __eou__ oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day. __eou__ no. those you have to provide for yourself. __eou__ what do most of the students do? __eou__ well, most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, but some of the education majors have had them made, because they will be faculty members, and they'll need them f __eou__ then, I might as well have them made. __eou__ Mary, don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty. __eou__ hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin. __eou__ it doesn't matter. Say'cheese'. __eou__ here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her? __eou__ Certainly. Ok, got you. __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question? __eou__ No, not at all. Go ahead. __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things. Most importantly, I practice every chance I get. __eou__ It's a good idea to have a radio, isn't it? __eou__ Sure. It's like understanding on the telephone you can't see the speaker! It's great for improving listening comprehension. __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language, doesn't it? __eou__ It certainly does. But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress. __eou__
Good morning, Sue. __eou__ Good morning, Tom.How are you? __eou__ I'm fine, thanks, how about yourself? __eou__ Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now? __eou__ I am heading for the library. I've got a research project to do.How about you? __eou__ I'm going to the English class.It'll start in five minutes, I've got to run. __eou__ See you later, alligator. __eou__ After a while, crocodile. __eou__
Is the environment a big issues in your country? It is in mine. __eou__ It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water. The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important. __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water? __eou__ Water is rationed. We can only use a certain amount each month. It means that we cannot use some modern household items, like washing machines. They use too much water. __eou__ I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution. __eou__ Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, my country is more agricultural and has much less industry. __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, but cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced. __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it. __eou__ I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem. __eou__
Hurry up. Time is running out. __eou__ I see. I have run as fast as I can. __eou__
Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section. __eou__ Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good, good. This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note. Now let's take a look at this __eou__ Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here? __eou__ It might work. I'll have to hear it.Show me what you'Ve done. __eou__ It was horrible! I played play it much better at home! __eou__ It's just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good. Don't forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better? __eou__ Yes, much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that? __eou__ Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make. __eou__ That's ok, keep going, you're moving ahead by leaps and bounds. Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the keys, don't pound. That's better! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
Can you tell me the time? __eou__ It's 5:30 by my watch. __eou__ Is your watch right? __eou__ Yes. There's only a few seconds in a whole month. __eou__
I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night. __eou__ Are you angry, Lisa? __eou__ Angry? Why would I be? __eou__ Please don't tell my mom. __eou__ Come on. Dating is a part of young people's social life. Besides, you're sixteen already. __eou__ I'm glad that you see it that way. __eou__ Do you want to borrow my coat? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you. __eou__ Thank you so much, Lisa! __eou__
Hi, Mary, long time no see. __eou__ I heard through the grapevine that your getting married. __eou__ Yes, next March. __eou__ Congratulations, I hope everything works out. __eou__
Jim and you are bosom friends, aren't you? __eou__ I wouldn't say so. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ Well, I thought he was, but he ends up to be a con man. __eou__
is everything alright? __eou__ yes, everything is fine. __eou__ what took so long? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about a delay. I thought everything was running on time. What happened? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time, but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem. __eou__ then what? Your plane was three hours late! __eou__ we finally took off, but about 30 minutes later, the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight. __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal, isn't it? __eou__ yes, but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early. __eou__ so where did you land? __eou__ we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again. __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare! __eou__ it wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive. __eou__ have you had anything to eat? __eou__ I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant. How about you? __eou__ I had a few coffees while I was waiting. Let's get out of here! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry. __eou__ Don't worry about it. It's not new, it already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt? __eou__ No, thank you. __eou__ That's the most important thing. __eou__ It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid. __eou__ Forget about it. __eou__ When you lent me the bike, it looked brand new, almost anyway. __eou__ Maybe, but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well. __eou__ I appreciate that, thank you. __eou__
What date is it today? __eou__ Today is December 23,2002. __eou__ Oh, the day after tomorrow is Christmas. __eou__ Merry Christmas to you! __eou__
Hello! I'm Penny, I moved here just now. __eou__ Oh, Penny, I'm Leonard, glad to meet you. __eou__ Nice to meet you, too. I thought I should come and say hello to you. I haven't known anybody. __eou__ It is hard to get used to a new place, isn't it? __eou__ Yes. Would you like to come here later to have a coffee? Bring all your family. __eou__ We'd like to. Can you tell me when we go? __eou__ About 4. __eou__ OK. Do you want us to bring something? __eou__ No, just come here. __eou__ OK, see you later. __eou__ Bye. __eou__
You know what, last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor. __eou__ Oh, how dreadful! I'm ever so sorry. __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious. __eou__ Thank God! __eou__
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York, to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida. __eou__ That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there. __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong, it might damage the eyes and the skin. __eou__ You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer. __eou__ I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good. __eou__ You said it. __eou__
I just finished reading this article'Getting Old Gracefully'. It's a very good article. __eou__ What does it say? __eou__ A lot of things. There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless. You really should read it. __eou__ Thank you. But I don't think I'll bother. __eou__ Why not? What this article says makes good sense to me. If you read it, I'm sure you'll agree with me. __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old. But perhaps you can keep the article for a while, I may read it later. __eou__
Thanks for coming shopping with me. __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me. __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before. __eou__ You're going to do great. And you're going to look great. __eou__ Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion. __eou__ I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you. __eou__ The question is, can he have it done before Friday? __eou__ These guys are professional. I think they can have it done tomorrow. Let's ask. __eou__
I love slim girls, don't you? __eou__ Not particularly. I like fat girls. __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin, do you? __eou__ I can't say I do. What I like a girl with good manners. __eou__ Well, yes. But surely you like a girl with a nice figure. __eou__ Yes. But I like a girl with a nice personality. __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich, surely? __eou__ Not particularly. I like a girl to be good. __eou__
What's going on here? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets. I got one last year and I had good luck all year! __eou__ Master Li? Who's that? __eou__ He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master! Quick! Get in line! __eou__ I will! I could use some good luck! __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff? __eou__ Yes, I do. The look of a picture is very important. __eou__ I think sound is even more important! Guns, bombs, sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose. __eou__ In my book, all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up. __eou__ Enough! If we don't finish the game, there won't be time for any movies tonight! __eou__
What day is today? __eou__ It's Thursday, I think. __eou__ Tomorrow is Friday. It's going to be the weekend. __eou__ We're busy on weekdays, but we'll have a good rest at the weekend. __eou__ We'll meet again in a few days. __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life. __eou__ Try to keep cool. It's not an easy take. __eou__ I know. I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst. __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom. __eou__
What day is it today? __eou__ It's Friday. __eou__
Are you new to this school? __eou__ Yes, I'm new. __eou__ Is this your first year in college? __eou__ I transferred from another school. __eou__ Where did you transfer from? __eou__ I was at PCC before. __eou__ Why did you transfer? __eou__ I was going to go here first, but my grades weren't good enough. __eou__ Did you like it at PCC? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school. __eou__ Well, I wish you luck here. __eou__ I'm sure I'll like it here. __eou__
There is something wrong with my girlfriend. __eou__ What's the trouble? __eou__ The department manager is all over her. He says he loves her. __eou__ What about your friend? Did she fall for him? __eou__ Of course not! She thinks he's an apple-head. She doesn't like an apple-headed man, you know. __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach, do you? __eou__
Are you ready to go to the bank? __eou__ Sure, what do you need to do there? __eou__ There's problem with my bank statement. There's a mistake on it. I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM. __eou__ I have to exchange some money. __eou__ that's right. You're going away next week. __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week. __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, the credit card company will charge me interest. __eou__ Their interest rates are usually quite high. It's a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest. __eou__
It's so relaxing, taking a walk in the country. The air is so fresh and clean. __eou__ would you like to live in the country? I'm not sure I'd like it. __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together. __eou__ I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities. __eou__ People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, but there's more to do. __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings. __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes. __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful. __eou__ Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods. __eou__ You're right. I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends. I would hate living in the country! __eou__
Hey Mike. What are you doing? __eou__ Nothing much. What are you up to? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately. __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed. __eou__ That sucks. He must feel depressed. __eou__ Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days. __eou__ Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him. __eou__ That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else. __eou__ Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done. __eou__ Sounds good. __eou__
Did you hear Peter just retired? __eou__ Are you sure? He is quite young, isn't he? __eou__ He is not young as he looks. I think he's almost sixty. __eou__ Really? He looks so young. __eou__
Hello, Steven. Congratulations! __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ How's your married life? __eou__ We're happy together now. We both think that we're a well-matched couple. __eou__ That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right. __eou__ The situation differs in person. __eou__
We have waited for a long time. When will we start? __eou__ Take it easy. I have to cut my losses. __eou__
are you working overtime again? Over the last two weeks, you have worked overtime every day without a break! Your company is draining the life out of you! __eou__ I know, but I don't have a choice, my boss has complete control over our work schedules. I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week. __eou__ Well, I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work... __eou__ No, not exactly, I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime. Overtime is our own time. __eou__ What?! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, they should give you some kind of compensation. __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, but frankly, it's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars. __eou__ That's just wrong! why don't you just quit? __eou__ I would, but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job. I don't have very many job marketable skills, there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for. __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now! __eou__
The tranquility of the night, the chirping of some insects, everything is so natural! __eou__ I felt as if I had been in a different world. __eou__ And I was overwhelmed by this scene, too. __eou__
I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening. __eou__ Let me check. Hold on, please... Yes, that's fine. Smoking or nonsmoking area? __eou__ Nonsmoking, please. __eou__ All right. May I have your name? __eou__ My surname is Gao. __eou__ How do you spell it, sir? __eou__
OK. Come back into the classroom, class. __eou__ Does the class start again, Mam? __eou__ Yes, but to the health, this break has long enough. __eou__ Oh, breaktime flies. __eou__ come on, baby. It's time now. __eou__ Mam, another minute, could I? __eou__ Hurry up, little boy. __eou__
why are you so upset today, Maria? Cheer up! __eou__ oh, Iris, it's about the job with the PR company. __eou__ it's a great opportunity. You should be happy with the offer. __eou__ but my mother won't allow me to accept any part-time job. I'm afraid she will say no again. __eou__ why? It's unfair. You can learn a lot from it. __eou__ she says a part-time job is cursed blessing. It takes so much time and energy that I won't be able to focus on my studys. __eou__ that may be true. But I'm sure you're able to find a balance between them. Why not try it? __eou__ I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I'm a senior now, I don't want to miss the chance this time. __eou__ I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind. __eou__ I'll try, but what if she insists? __eou__ just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding. And more importantly, you can manage both your study and the job. __eou__ do you think it will work? __eou__ sure. Every cloud has its silver lining. Just try. __eou__ ok, I'll do that. Thank you, Iris. __eou__ sure. Good luck, Maria! __eou__
Where did you go yesterday? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park. __eou__ How often do you play tennis? __eou__ Twice a week. How about you? __eou__ I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball. __eou__ What is very difficult to gather team player together. __eou__ I usually play with my school-mates. __eou__ Do you like watching football matches? __eou__ Yes. I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday. __eou__
Why are you all dressed up? __eou__ I've got a date. __eou__
I'm sick of my job, I always have to work late at night, and the company keeps me working in the office. __eou__ Why don't you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy, being outside working during the day? __eou__ What do you suggest? I can't afford to quit my job until I get a new one. __eou__ Maybe you have two choices. You could attend school during the day, or you could get a position that provides training. __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night. It was about elderly people. __eou__ And what did the program say? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier. __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea. __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress. __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, and he lifts weights every day. __eou__
Saying you want to kill yourself, you terrified me out of my wits. __eou__ I was playing a joke on you. __eou__ That's too much. __eou__ Dear, forgive me. I won't do that again. __eou__
Where are you going this weekend? __eou__ I'm going to Hainan. __eou__ Oh really? It'll be nice and warm there. Have you been there before? __eou__ Yes, actually it's my second visit. I was there last October. __eou__ I see. What's it like there? __eou__ Well, the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city. And the seafood is tastier! __eou__ Well, have a great time! __eou__
Hurry up, Daniel, it's Barbie time. __eou__ All right, Sis! __eou__ Come on, it's cool outside. __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us. __eou__ Hey, Daniel, what's your favorite weather? Snowy or sunny? __eou__ Me? Er, I like hot weather, just like today. __eou__ What? Are you crazy? __eou__ I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out. __eou__ Ew, Danny, gross! __eou__ By the way, what's your favorite weather? __eou__ I love snowy, because it is very very romantic. __eou__ Look, is that Tom? __eou__
My girlfriend dumped me. __eou__ Well, that's life. __eou__
Did Roll win the race? __eou__ Yeah, he did. But he only won it by a hair's breadth. __eou__ But anyway, he won at last. __eou__ Yeah. To win is the most important thing. __eou__
What's this then? __eou__ It's my geography, sir.The Map of Africa you set us. __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday. __eou__ Yes, I know, sir. I'm sorry. __eou__ Well, what's your excuse then? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home. __eou__ Oh, Yes? __eou__ It's true, sir. __eou__
Hey, This is your order. __eou__ Are you new here? I come to this coffeehouse often. But I didn't see you here before. __eou__ Yes. I started this part-time job just three days ago. And my internship will last 1 week. I'm still a student now. __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here? __eou__ Of course not. You know, there are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English. __eou__ Oh, are you an English student? Or you just study English for interest's sake? __eou__ No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English. I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language. So I try to improve my English. __eou__ Very nice. Thank you for your time. __eou__ Thank you, sir. But I'm not allowed to accept any tips. __eou__ OK then. I don't want to put you in trouble. __eou__ Well, would you like something else? The new-made cafe parfait is really good. Want some? __eou__ OK. But I'd like some cookies. __eou__ Sure. If you want more coffee, please go over there. There is self-help coffee maker. __eou__ I surely know that. Don't forget that I am a regular customer here. __eou__ Oops. Well, wait for a while. We'll get it done quickly. __eou__ It's OK. Thank you. __eou__
Do you think the bad weather will last long? __eou__ I don't think so. It changes so quickly this time. __eou__ I hope so. We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it. __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum. It's worth seeing. You can go to the square some other time. __eou__ Good idea. Thanks a billion. __eou__
Let's go in. __eou__ After you. __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? __eou__ Pardon? __eou__ What university would you enter? __eou__ University? Why? You asked me last year. __eou__ Oh, I forget. Sorry. __eou__ I went to Harvard University. __eou__ Did you? And what course did you take there? __eou__ God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you? __eou__ I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory. __eou__ I did a B. A. in economics. Remember? __eou__ Terrific! B. A., again and again-B. A. __eou__
I think he deserved his gold. __eou__ Did you see his last dive? __eou__ Yes, it's perfect! __eou__ He's diving for the gold. __eou__
You are studying here, aren't you? __eou__ Yes. I have been here for three years. __eou__ Do you like this campus? __eou__ Well. I'm rather disappointed with it. __eou__ How come? __eou__ It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected. __eou__ Oh.It's awful, but it can't be helped. __eou__ I'll just have to put up with it. __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe! __eou__ Don't be too humble. Few young men could be equal to Mark. And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck. __eou__ I agree. Both Joe and Mark are men of guts. __eou__
Hi Mark. __eou__ Hi. __eou__ What are you planning to do today? __eou__ I'm not sure yet. __eou__ Would you like to have lunch with me? __eou__ Yes. When? __eou__ Is 11:30 AM OK? __eou__ Sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you say that again please? __eou__ I said, 11:30 AM. __eou__ Oh, I'm busy then. Can we meet a little later? __eou__ OK, how about 12:30 PM? __eou__ OK. Where? __eou__ How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant? __eou__ Oh, Where is that? __eou__ It's on 7th Street. __eou__ OK, I'll meet you there. __eou__
How have you been? __eou__ Fine, thanks. How about you? __eou__
Hi, Monica, congratulations! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech. And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project. You really made a big contribution to our company. __eou__ Thank you, I just tried my best. I am very happy to know you like it. __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time. Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find, right? __eou__ Well, yes. Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that. They are very supportive. I consulted an economic expert last week. He was very kind to give valuable suggestions. __eou__ Now, the effort pays off. You have accomplished something. __eou__ Come on, don't flatter me anymore. I took the job because I love being challenged. But I can't get this turned around without the support from you people. __eou__
I hate to say goodbye, but it's late. __eou__ Can't you stay for a little bit longer, it's only 8. __eou__ I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't. I've got some serious studying to do. I have to go. __eou__ OK.See you on Today. __eou__ See you on Moday.Have a great weekend. __eou__ You too.Thanks for dropping in. __eou__
Are you really dating with Frank? __eou__ Yeah. But in my heart of hearts, I find he's not very much to my liking. __eou__ Then why not keep away from him? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now. __eou__ That's stupid. __eou__
Hi, Jim. How are you? I haven't seen you for a while. __eou__ I'm fine. I've been out of town. I just got back. __eou__ Where were you? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding. __eou__
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading? __eou__ I like it a lot. It has a very funny beginning, I think. It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it. __eou__ What do you like best about it? __eou__ I like the plot. It's so full of twists and turns. I also like the main character. She is so humorous and smart. __eou__ What do you think of the ending? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak. It's so abrupt, like those of most other detective stories. __eou__
Quite a few times, I had my back to the wall. __eou__ Really? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ You'll exert all your energy and get out of it. __eou__
Is that your phone? __eou__ Yes, it's my new business phone. Do you like it? __eou__ It's very impressive. Can you use the Internet on your phone? __eou__ Yes, it's got wireless Internet access. __eou__ That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth? __eou__ Yes, but I don't really use it often. Have you ever used it? __eou__ No, but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go. __eou__ Yes, I guess I should try to use it. __eou__
Good morning, Mary! __eou__ Good morning, John! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday. Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday? __eou__ I'd be delighted to, John. Saturday did you say? __eou__ Yes, if that's all right for you. __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start? __eou__ Oh, good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner. __eou__ That sounds fine. I'll be there around seven. __eou__
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll do better next time. __eou__ I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition. __eou__ It doesn't matter. Forget it. __eou__ I don't think I performed well. __eou__ Oh! That's much hetter than I did. __eou__ Can you tell me how to improve myself? __eou__ There's no secret at all. The only thing for you to do is to practice more. You will succeed. __eou__ Thank you for your encouragement. __eou__ It's a pleasure. Come on. I'm on your side. __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye. __eou__ What time are you leaving? __eou__ I'll leave at 10 o'clock. __eou__ Take care and give my best to you parents. __eou__ Thank you, I will. Hope to see you again next year. __eou__
Come back. You haven't paid yet. __eou__ May, just let him go. __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying. __eou__ I know. __eou__ Why? You make me confused. __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines, read the political sections and return them later. __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him. __eou__ I see. Does he live by himself? __eou__ Yes, he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle. __eou__ He must be lonely? __eou__ I bet. But he is always busy telling the children stories. __eou__ How respectable! __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I need to get on the Internet. __eou__ Do you have your library card with you? __eou__ Yes, I have it. __eou__ You're going to have to wait for a computer. __eou__ That's okay. __eou__ Please put your name on this list. __eou__ Then what do I need to do? __eou__ When there is a computer available, I will call you. __eou__ What do I do to log on to the computer? __eou__ Just type in the number on the back of your library card. __eou__ Okay. Thanks for your help. __eou__
Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane? __eou__ Yes, I am. When is the wedding? __eou__ Aug 8. __eou__ August bride. How nice! By the way, who is going to be the matron of honor? __eou__ Mrs. White. __eou__ Oh, yeah? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding. You know her father passed away several years ago. __eou__ Maybe her uncle will. __eou__ I think so. The wedding will be held at her church, right? __eou__ Right. Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding. __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon? __eou__ Yes, Jane says they will go to China. __eou__
Don't do that again. You are riding the tiger. __eou__ No problem. I can deal with it well. __eou__ You will ask for it. __eou__ All is best now, isn't it? __eou__
Hurry up! Time is money! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me. I know the importance of time. __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them. __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best? __eou__
Watch out! You'll hit that car if you're not careful. __eou__ Oh no, I won't. But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting. __eou__ You see. I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful. __eou__ Oh, shut up, will you? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened. __eou__ Oh, so it was my fault, was it? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse. __eou__
Steve, you look pale. What happened? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night. __eou__ Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned. Maybe I can help you. __eou__ Well, I am under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me three projects. Now the deadlines are near, and I still have not finished all of my projects. __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help you? __eou__ Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to, so that I can relieve my stress. __eou__
Lodge, You must come around sometime, You have to check out my mew stereo. __eou__ Sure, When is good time for you? __eou__ Can you make it on Tuesday? __eou__ What time do you want me there? __eou__ Anytime after six will be fine. __eou__ All right, It's a date. __eou__
My friend Jean is very beautiful. __eou__ What's her figure? __eou__ Perfect, and I like her charming eyes too. __eou__ What's the color of her eyes? __eou__ Dark blue. __eou__
What's the life expectancy in your country? __eou__ I'm not sure, but probably about 75 years. How about in your country? __eou__ About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world. __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly. __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday. __eou__ Did she? That's great. However, if we have too many children, that will have a bad effect on the enviroment. __eou__ How's your son these days? __eou__ Oh, he's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays. __eou__ He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you think it is a good age to have a child? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24. that's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., or even in your early thirties if you have a good career. __eou__ Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, but not just yet. __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country? __eou__ Yes, there is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don't often succeed. __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom. __eou__ It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, they might go wild. __eou__
Hey Mike. I forgot about registration. I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. What do you think I should do? __eou__ You're screwed. You can't do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful. __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all? __eou__ No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way. __eou__ Did you register yet? __eou__ Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss. __eou__ What classes do you think are still open? __eou__ Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology. __eou__ That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester. __eou__ I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full. __eou__ He does that? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class. __eou__ That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help. __eou__ No problem, man. __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house. __eou__ Any time. I'm just glad I could help. __eou__
I've been so stressed these days. __eou__ What's the matter? Are you OK? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college, and what to major in. __eou__ Don't worry. You have plenty of time to decide. __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition. I want to get the burden off my family. __eou__ You always worry too much about everything. Take it easy, honey. You are good enough. You can go to the ideal college. __eou__ OK, OK. I'm so sorry. By the way, for you, is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work? __eou__ In a perfect world, I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much, and make lots of money! __eou__ OK, honey, stop dreaming. You should face the reality. __eou__ That's only a joke. To be honest, I have to improve my English, because my English is not good enough. I still get confused about some simple grammars. Since you are quite good at it, do you have any suggestions? __eou__ En, first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class. Second, I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center. __eou__ Is the training center helpful? __eou__ I think so. Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation. __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time. __eou__ Yes, they do. Do you have a Christmas tree this year? __eou__ Yes, we have a big tree this year. I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday. Do you want to come and see it? __eou__ I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother. __eou__ When can you come? __eou__ I don't know when I can come. I'll let you know later. __eou__
You know, smoking does do harm to your health. __eou__ Yes, you're right. __eou__ Why don't you try to give it up? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times, but it's no good. Smoking relaxes me. __eou__ Have you ever thought of just cutting down? You could do it gradually. __eou__ Yes, maybe I should have another try. __eou__
Hello, Jim. What was the film like? __eou__ Awful. It was a complete waste of time. __eou__ Why? What was it about? __eou__ It was about a married couple. They had to live with the wife's mother, because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own. __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that. __eou__ Yes. but the husband had to work overtime three times a week, so he was always tired. __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life. __eou__ Yes, it does, doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night. __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes. __eou__ Yes, but not two every night. Anyway, the strain was too much for him. He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital. __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film. __eou__ Not really. His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter, because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months'work, she had a better job than her husband. So in the end, __eou__ I don't know. My wife used to speak French. I must tell her to brush it up. __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs? __eou__ Sure. __eou__ Let's get a soft drink. __eou__ Do we have enough time? __eou__ It's a fifteen-minute intermission. __eou__ The seats are excellent. We're right in the center. __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great. __eou__ I can't agree more. __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert? __eou__ In the United States, yes. But back in China, I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents. __eou__ Do you have large concert halls in your city? __eou__ We have two. One is like this one. The other is a little smaller. __eou__ That's great. Well, we'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start. __eou__
May I help you? __eou__ What time will the library be closing? __eou__ It closes at six. __eou__ Does it always close at six? __eou__ No, not every day. __eou__ Will the library be open on Saturday? __eou__ Absolutely. __eou__ What are your hours on Saturday? __eou__ Saturday's hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night. __eou__ All right. Thank you. __eou__ What else can I help you with? __eou__ That's it. Thank you. __eou__
Whose part do you think is best played? __eou__ That of the old man. __eou__ You're absolutely right! That's the very figure I like best. __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears. __eou__
Vince, I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker. __eou__ Pardon? __eou__ I won't say who, because I'm not sure yet. But I'll know soon. __eou__ Zina, I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad. __eou__ It isn't Elvin. __eou__ Dave then? Dave is a spy for WebTracker? You can't be serious. __eou__ Loan me that tape recorder you have. And don't say anything to anyone until I come back. __eou__
Hello, Zhang lin! Fancy meeting you here! __eou__ Hi, Lin Tao. I have't seen you for some time. __eou__ How's life going, Zhang Lin? __eou__ Yes, the same as ever, thanks. What about you? __eou__ Pretty good, thanks. I'm going to see my uncle. __eou__ Good bye then, and keep in touch. __eou__ Good bye. __eou__
Fixing computer isn't my cup of tea. You can leave this job to Jason. __eou__ Yeah, he has a good commend of computer skills. But... __eou__ But what? __eou__ But he is always talking big. __eou__
What a great weekend that was! __eou__ My feelings exactly. __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer. __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more. __eou__ We should come here more often. __eou__ You are absolutely right. __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend. __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel. __eou__
Aren't you going to swim? __eou__ Are you kidding? Don't you know I can't swim? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath, are you? __eou__ Hey, don't shout. Come here! Sit closer. Now, Jim, we'Ve had a lovely day. Don't spoil it now. __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit? We shopped all day. Don't you want to show it off? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it. Besides, it's a good sunbathing suit. __eou__ All right. Suit yourself. I am going swimming. __eou__ Jim! __eou__ Yes? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair? I am really tired of lying in thousand. __eou__ I've got a better idea. Why don't we hire a boat and go for a ride? What do you think? __eou__ Are you serious? That will be wonderful! __eou__
How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer? __eou__ I'm sorry, but you were the only one who had access to it. __eou__
The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain. __eou__ I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures. __eou__ I'm sure they will. __eou__
Adam, could you show me around the school? __eou__ No problem. __eou__ What's the tallest building? __eou__ You mean the white building near the playground? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ That is the library. And it has more than 1,000, 000 books. __eou__ What's the building to the south of the library? __eou__ You know, our school is divided into two parts, the junior high school and the senior high school. That is the new classroom building for our senior high school. __eou__ Is there a swimming pool in your school? __eou__ Yes. There is a large swimming pool, but it is only available in summer. __eou__ I do envy you. And I hope I can enter your school one day. __eou__ I believe that you can make your dream come true. __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention, but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough. Lesley, got a television. how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish. __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster? __eou__ Un... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see... Mm, it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching. __eou__ Aha, but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get... get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things... best programmes that... that undoubtedly are on television? __eou__ Well, I suppose one of the problems is... will depend on what a person's life style is, and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, he will then, you know, hmm. be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things. __eou__ Do you think though that... that in... in a sense television skilled people's own er... sort of, creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television? __eou__ Yes, I think that is a danger, and I think that.. in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their... their main... um field of amusement and... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be, you know, particularly interested in talking to them, you Know the television will be the main thing in the room. __eou__
Don't be shy. Have some more chicken. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__
I feel pity for the old man. __eou__ I feel the same way. __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old. __eou__ Yeah. He has no one to count on. __eou__
I'm going to see the doctor this weekend. __eou__ What's your trouble? __eou__ I think I need a thorough check-up. __eou__ I got it. __eou__
Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today. __eou__ What is the problem? __eou__ I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative. __eou__ Are you planning on having someone take notes for you? __eou__ Yes, I've got that part covered. __eou__ When, exactly do you need to leave? __eou__ I don't need to leave until the very end of class. __eou__ Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again. __eou__ Thanks, Professor. See you later! __eou__ See you later! Drive carefully. __eou__
I'm going to try sky diving this weekend. __eou__ I wouldn't do it if I were you. __eou__ It's sounds like fun. __eou__ It's very dangerous, you know. __eou__ I want to try something exciting. __eou__ It's an easy way to get hurt, let me tell you. __eou__ I'll tell you all about it next Monday. __eou__ Well, take care of yourself, and don't say I didn't warn you. __eou__
Does he know that he has already at his wits'end? __eou__ I think he has realized that. But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act. __eou__ He might be driven up a wall. You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves. __eou__ But when I noticed that he was left in the cold, I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation. __eou__
I visited the famous variety show host, Dennis. __eou__ What's he like? __eou__ Oh, he's a very serious person. __eou__ You must feel very uneasy at his home. __eou__
Hi! My name is Mike. __eou__ Hi! I'm Nancy. Nice to meet you. __eou__ Nice to meet you, too. __eou__ Where are you from? __eou__ I'm from Shanghai. And you? __eou__ I'm from Chicago. __eou__
Why do you go fishing so often? __eou__ It's fun. __eou__
Hi, Cindy. I thought I'd missed you. __eou__ Oh, I am very sorry, Hans. Thank you for waiting for me. You must have been here a long time already. __eou__ It's all right. __eou__ I was caught in the heavy rain, or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting. __eou__ I was in a comfortable place, so really, it's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long? __eou__ Yes. When I came out of the subway, it was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up. __eou__ I totally understand. __eou__
Good morning, Jim! __eou__ Good morning, Emma! A lovely day, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, it is. The sun is shining. There is no wind, only a pleasant breeze. __eou__ It is the best season for a picnic right now. Have you decided the place for your picnic? __eou__ We have decided to go to the park this Sunday. Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet? __eou__ What did the whetherman say? __eou__ He's predicting clear skies. __eou__ Well, I will think it over. __eou__
Come in, come in, what can I do for you? __eou__ Professor Donald, are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester? __eou__ Yes, I am applying on it. __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, but... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up. __eou__ I know, but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field. __eou__ Well, if you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll. __eou__ Oh, thanks, professor Donald. This is really very nice of you. __eou__
Management is going through a big turnover these days. With Bill's retirement, and department realignment, we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff. They've been dropping like flies... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing? Having fewer bosses means having less stress, don't you think? __eou__ Actually, I don't think so. Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace. They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees. If there is no one to keep an eye on us, no one would get any work done. You know what they say, when the cat's away, the mice play. __eou__ You're right, we do need leadership. But what we don't need is too many people to lead us. You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians... __eou__ Alright... I get your point. __eou__
How do you like your job here, Linda? __eou__ It's interesting, I like being an editor. __eou__ Why? __eou__ I like talking to writers, I get to meet a lot of interesting people. __eou__ I'm happy to hear that, but publishing is more than just talking to writers. it involves a lot of work, patience and responsibility. Most of the work is boring. __eou__ I don't feel bored at all. I'm getting along with my colleagues. I will enjoy working with them. People are great in this industry. __eou__ Do you have any complaints? __eou__ No, I have no complaints. I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company. is that true? __eou__ Yes, you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well. __eou__ That's perfect. I will definitely do well. __eou__
I don't think we've met. __eou__ No, I don't think we have. __eou__ My name is Dick Brown. __eou__ How do you do? Mr. Brown. I am Susan Heywood. __eou__ Mr. Smith often talked about you. __eou__ Really? I am glad to meet you. __eou__ I'm honored to know you. __eou__
Why don't you sit down and relax, darling? __eou__ I don't want to. __eou__ Well, come and talk to me then. __eou__ Certainly not. __eou__ May I turn on the radio then? __eou__ Turn on the radio? What for? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music. __eou__ Listen to some music? And who'll cook dinner? Will you? __eou__ Ok, I will. But let's go to a disco after dinner. __eou__ To a disco? Oh, no. You know I hate pop. __eou__
David, why don't you clean your room? __eou__ I am not in the mood. __eou__ Why are you feeling depress? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. It's a real letdown. __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing. __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed. __eou__ Oh, cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything. __eou__ But she means a lot to me. __eou__ Then forgive her mistake. __eou__ Oh, I just can't forget it. __eou__
My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday __eou__ What happened? __eou__ She was hit by a car. Luckily, she wasn't seriously hurt. __eou__ Let's buy some flowers, and pay her a visit __eou__ We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon __eou__ OK. Let's go __eou__

What do you do when you are angry? __eou__ I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger. __eou__ That's smart. What do you usually do to relieve your anger? __eou__ Something like listening to music is a good idea. __eou__ Oh, what kind of music do you listen to? __eou__ Classic. Something that could calm your mind. __eou__ I think that might work for me as well. __eou__ Working out is another good way to relieve anger. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ Jogging, yoga, or even just taking a walk. __eou__
I'm sorry, but I can't come to your party. __eou__ What a shame! __eou__
Taylor, you're sweating up a storm! __eou__ Your boyfriend, Bryan, wanted to toss the football. I think he wore me out. __eou__ Yeah, you look a little shaky. And pale. You seriously need some time in the sun. __eou__ You're like the tenth person to say that. __eou__ We're just worried about you, Taylor. __eou__ Whatever. I wish people would just leave me alone! __eou__
She is so stupid. __eou__ Who cares? She is pretty. __eou__ So what? __eou__ You're just jealous. __eou__

What a police officer! __eou__ I'Ve never seem such a scene either except in films. __eou__ It's really unimaginable. The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language, but the driver took it on the chin. __eou__
In my wedding ceremony, where do my parents sit in the church? __eou__ The bride's parents'seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side. __eou__ Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other? __eou__ They usually do. __eou__
Hi, Mary! You're here already. Where's Harry? __eou__ He isn't a punctual person. We may have to wait for a little while. __eou__ That should give us time for a cup of coffee. I'll go and get some. __eou__ Make it three cups. Here comes Harry. __eou__
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class? __eou__ Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely. __eou__ I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher. I know she was angry, but that's still no excuse for rudeness. __eou__
Is your city a historical place? __eou__ Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. __eou__ How did it grow into such a large place? __eou__ Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre. __eou__ As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby. __eou__ Yes, it did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city. __eou__ I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city? __eou__ Oh, yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, so our city has a castle too. __eou__ Really? So your city does have some old history after all. __eou__
What is wrong with your face? __eou__ My brother did it. __eou__ Why? __eou__ I laughed up my sleeves at him. He's seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it. __eou__
How's Jerry's new school? __eou__ Very nice. He gets along with his classmates very well. __eou__ He's a team player. __eou__ Yes, indeed. __eou__
How many people are there in your family? __eou__ Five.My father, mother, brother, sister-in-law and me. __eou__ Is your brother older or younger than you? __eou__ He is five years older than me, He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age. __eou__
What's the problem? You don't look happy. __eou__ I failed my oral test. __eou__ How come? __eou__ I'm not practicing enough. __eou__ Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often? __eou__ When I talk to Chinese, I always want to speak Chinese. __eou__ You should always keep in mind, the more you practice, the better English you can speak. __eou__
It's dangerous. I don't dare to go. __eou__ Come on. It's quite safe. You really have no guts. __eou__
Did you get the car you wanted? __eou__ No. Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it. __eou__ What about the car over there? __eou__ It is marvelous, and the price is marvelous, as well. __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I want to return this video. __eou__ Is that all you need? __eou__ I also need to check this magazine out. __eou__ You're not allowed to do that. __eou__ I don't understand. __eou__ It's our policy. __eou__ What can I check out? __eou__ Only books or videos. __eou__ I need this magazine. __eou__ You will have to read it here. __eou__ That's weird. __eou__
Have you heard the news? __eou__ No. What happened? __eou__
Such bad luck, 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today. __eou__ Don't be angry, you lose money just to avoid misfortune. __eou__ Well, you can just comfort yourself like that. __eou__
Ok, so who are we going to invite to our dinner party? __eou__ Well, we have the Thompsons, the Greens, and the Anderson, about twelve people total. __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office. He has nothing to do on Friday, so I invited him over. __eou__ But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday! __eou__ Why can't we? __eou__ It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date? __eou__ I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon. __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a superstition. It really doesn't mean anything. __eou__ Absolutely not! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday! __eou__ Ok, ok. I'll ask my sister to come. That way we'll have fourteen for dinner. __eou__ That's better. __eou__
Hello, 8520388 2. __eou__ Hi, this is Maria. Is that Shirley? __eou__ Hi, Maria, this is Shirley. __eou__ Shirley, do you know today's homework from our economic law class? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now. __eou__ Hold on for a moment please. I'm fetching my textbook. __eou__ OK. __eou__ Oh, the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense. __eou__ Explain the economic law? An essay question again? __eou__ Yes. You can use your textbook for your reference. __eou__ Are there any clear answers in the book to this question? __eou__ I don't think so, Maria, but I think you can look for information on the Internet. __eou__ OK, thank you, Shirley. You are very helpful. I have another question. When does the Economic Law of China come into effect? __eou__ Oh, there isn't such a code called economic law. The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws. __eou__ There isn't such a code? __eou__ Yes, it's a general name for several laws related to economics, like Commercial Law, and Law of Central Bank. __eou__ Got it. Thank you, Shirley. __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye. __eou__ What time are you leaving? __eou__ I'll leave at ten o'clock. __eou__ Take care, and give my best to your parents. __eou__ Thank you, I will. Hope to see you again next year. __eou__
The performance is amazing. I'm curious about how they did it. I mean the way they sing. __eou__ They must have practiced a lot. The perseverance has made them they are today. __eou__ So cool. Someone gave me this flier at the exit. What's it about? __eou__ Let me have a look. Well, it lists some shows that will be on next week. __eou__ Oh, tell me about it. Anything interesting? __eou__ Hmm... Oh, this one,'The Drunken Beauty'. This is a real classic. __eou__'The Drunken Beauty'? It's funny that we have'Sleeping Beauty'in my country. Anyway, what's it about? Is the beauty a drunkard? __eou__ Of course not. She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen. They play was famous for its singing and dancing. __eou__ Sure, people do that when they are drunk. What about the actress? __eou__ She is an opera star in China. Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang. __eou__ Oh, I've heard about him before. He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking. __eou__ You are such an expert on it. I don't know that. __eou__ You know, interest is the best teacher. __eou__ So, want me to book the tickets again? __eou__ Please do that. I can't wait to come back again. The performance must be really amazing. __eou__ We can do that if you like. Maybe next weekend. __eou__ That will be great. __eou__
That was heaven! __eou__ The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you. __eou__ Really? __eou__ But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body. __eou__ Well, whatever it does, I feel transformed! __eou__
You got a letter in the mail. __eou__ Give it to me. __eou__ What is it? __eou__ It's from NYU. __eou__ What does it say? __eou__ I didn't get accepted. __eou__ You can't be serious! __eou__ I'm serious. __eou__ Are you all right? __eou__ NYU was my first choice. __eou__ I'm sorry that you didn't get in. __eou__ I'll just have to wait for UCLA. __eou__
What are you going to do for one year abroad, Tom? __eou__ Study, study, study. I want to learn a lot. __eou__ You are going to take courses? __eou__ Yes. I am going to take some university courses there. __eou__ Sounds hard. __eou__ Yes, but I think it's probably for the best. __eou__ Won't you get lonely? __eou__ Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, like fencing, or theater or something. __eou__
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning. __eou__ Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue. __eou__ So did i. that's why i didn't take my umbrella. i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs. __eou__ I know. i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon. __eou__ We really have some miserable weather sometime. i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round. __eou__ If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either. __eou__ I guess you are right. maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable. __eou__ The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable. __eou__
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars. They do everything together. __eou__ Birds of a feather flock together. __eou__
What's your new job like? __eou__ Oh, it's fine. I'Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office. __eou__ Um. __eou__ And a company car. __eou__ Very nice. __eou__ Yes, it is. But I'Ve got a lot of work too. __eou__ Well, that's life, isn't it? __eou__
What a surprise meeting you here, Landy. __eou__ I'm here as a tourist. __eou__ It's a small world, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, it's a small world. We never know where we'll meet someone we know. __eou__
So you're traveling around the world, aren't you. __eou__ That's right __eou__ When did you arrive here? __eou__ Last night __eou__ Did you have a good journey? __eou__ Yes, I enjoyed it very much. __eou__ Where have you been on this trip? __eou__ Let me see. Ah, yes, I've been to England, France, Germany, Italy and now I've been in Spain __eou__ Really? How long will your holiday last? __eou__ Two weeks __eou__ All these countries in two weeks? __eou__ That's right __eou__
Please do excuse me for a moment. I've got diarrhea. __eou__ It's easy to get loose bowels in summer. __eou__ It may have something to do with the food I had last night __eou__ You'Ve got to be careful on the food you eat. __eou__ I will. Thank you. __eou__
Hi Mary, how's it going? __eou__ Well, last night I had a big argument with Ann. __eou__ Terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends. __eou__ Now that I look back at it, it wasn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper. __eou__ Really? What happened? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, and we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip. I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all. __eou__ That's pretty harsh. __eou__ I know, but I was so upset. I mean, come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad. __eou__ Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often. __eou__ Well, in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want. __eou__ Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up. __eou__
I can't bear you anymore. I am sick of your drinking. I am divorcing you. __eou__ Don't do that to me, honey. Give me a chance, please. I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again. __eou__ How many chances should I give you? I've given up on you! __eou__ Have a heart, honey. You know I am trying hard to quit drinking, don't you? Just give me one more chance, please! __eou__
Finally the class is over. Be quick. Ben must have been waiting for long. __eou__ Oh, I am so tired. My back is sore and my neck hurts. __eou__ That's normal. You have been sitting for three hours, with your attention highly concentrated. __eou__ You are wrong, Shirley. I was always absent-minded in the class. I meant to concentrate on the class, but I was just so tired. Maybe I am old. __eou__ No. You are just burning yourself out these days. Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again. __eou__ One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year. He filled the school column with his name, and his score was relinquished. __eou__ How could he make such a silly mistake? __eou__ He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years, and couldn't get used to it immediately. He was extremely nervous then. __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college, didn't he? __eou__ Yeah. The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam. Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam. And there are fewer subjects. __eou__ That's a very good lesson. We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on. __eou__
What did you do over the weekend? __eou__ I went a global warming rally. It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment. __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ Well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start. __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment? __eou__ If you do have to drive, you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, your home should use sources of renewable energy. __eou__ How about recycling? Does that actually help? __eou__ Yes. You should take your glass, paper, plastic, cardboard, and tin cans to a recycling center. __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone. __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before! __eou__ To be honest, in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment. __eou__
Merry Christmas, Bill! __eou__ Merry Christmas. Steven! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping. What about you? __eou__ I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party. Would you like to come? __eou__ I'd love to. But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now. See you later. __eou__ See you. __eou__
So Emily, what do you like to do for fun? __eou__ I like to go to the movies. What do you do in your free time? __eou__ I also like going to the movies. __eou__ Well that's great! It's nice that we have something in common. __eou__
Who broke the glass, Peter? __eou__ That cat. __eou__ I was not born yesterday. It must be either you or Adam. __eou__ It's me, mum, I am sorry. __eou__
Can you read what this says? __eou__ Yes, and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face. __eou__ Don't dis my hair! I like it like this. __eou__ You like it, but it's getting to be a handicap for you. __eou__ Hey, that's enough about my hair. __eou__ I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too. __eou__ I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute. __eou__ Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too? __eou__
Hello, Tony. Fancy meeting you here. How are things going with you? __eou__ Not too bad, thanks. And you? __eou__ Pretty good! How are your parents these days? __eou__ Oh, they are fine.

I need to go. __eou__ Say hi to your family for me. __eou__ Thanks, I will, byebye! __eou__
Where should I sit? __eou__ Why don't you sit in the back with me? __eou__ Okay. __eou__ By the way, what's your last name? I forgot what it is. __eou__ It's Lin. It's spelled L-I-N. __eou__ R-I-N? __eou__ My pronunciation is not very good. It's L-I-N, Lin. __eou__ I got it. Mary Lin. __eou__ Lin is a common Chinese last name. __eou__
You're ready, right? __eou__ Ready for what? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer tomorrow? __eou__ Yes. I am ready. __eou__ You're not nervous? __eou__ Of course I'm nervous. __eou__ What are you most nervous about? __eou__ I won't know anybody at that school. __eou__ You shouldn't be nervous about that. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ Meeting new people is a good thing. __eou__ That's a good way to think about it. __eou__
What do you think of this one? __eou__ Eh, so so. __eou__ And this one? Too flashy? __eou__ Nah, not too flashy. __eou__ Hug! And this sweater from my aunt? Isn't it hideous? __eou__ I guess. __eou__ Are you even listening? I'm trying to have a conversation with you. __eou__ And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes! __eou__ Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon! __eou__ Well could you do me the favor of making this quick? It's the third quarter and you'Ve been blabbering on since the first! __eou__ Oh, your precious game. You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals! __eou__ Oh no you didn't. You didn't just insult the Sals-bury Seals, did you? Why don't you just. just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over? __eou__ I might just! Enjoy your stupid game! __eou__ And Merry Christmas! __eou__ Merry Christmas! __eou__
Don't be worried. Please sit down and take it easy. __eou__ How could I feel easy? I'm really pissed. __eou__ But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven't got the real facts. __eou__ Ok. I'll try my best to calm down first. __eou__
Hey, Mike. You've been surfing the Net for quite a while. What on earth are you searching for? __eou__ It's something relative hackers. I often hear people talking about them, but I don't know much about them. __eou__ Well, roughly speaking, a hacker is a computer buff. __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer? __eou__ You can say that. __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers. __eou__ What is crackers then? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but they aren't. They break into computers and break the phone system. Real hackers call these people crackers, and want nothing to do with them. __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts. __eou__ Well, the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible and not very bright, and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers. This irritates real hackers to no end. __eou__ I see. Then the basic different is, hackers build things, crackers break them. __eou__ You got it. __eou__ Thanks a lot. __eou__ You are welcome. __eou__
I don't have my homework today. __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened? __eou__ I was really sick. __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better? __eou__ Yes, I probably could. __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups? __eou__ Next class meeting. __eou__ That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, all right? __eou__ That would work for me. __eou__ Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student. __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs. I just finished reading one about cloning. __eou__ I'm not sure I like the idea of that. I don't want people copying me or other people. It could be very confusing. __eou__ According to the article, you have no real need to worry. Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts, not on recreating a whole human. __eou__ In the future, that could be possible. __eou__ In this article, scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person, there's no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original! __eou__ Really? What else have you discovered? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines. For example, an animal be immune to disease that affects human. So, scientists find out why it's immune __eou__ That's great, because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves. I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones. __eou__
Thanks for helping me up. __eou__ Are you OK? I didn't mean to put you in danger. __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here. I made three people fall over! __eou__ That takes talent... __eou__ I'm so humiliated! What's that man saying? Everyone's laughing! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies. __eou__
How was the party yesterday? __eou__ Did you enjoy it? __eou__ Oh, don't talk to me about yesterday! It was the most awful evening I've ever had. __eou__ Why! what happened? __eou__ Well.John had promised to be my date, but he stood me up. I waited for a full hour in the cold wind. __eou__ So how long did you stay? __eou__ I left after the opening dance. I couldn't wait to get out of there. __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left. It was just awe-inspiring. It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth, where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance. I wasn't quite prepared for that. It's inevitably etched in my memory. __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space, do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind? __eou__ Detached. You're literally detached from one planet, captured by another. Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y, it stays in view the whole time. __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality. Is it going to be some future project that never happens? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real. It without question has suffered a lot of delays. But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December. It is a reality. It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground. __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell. __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice, orbited space around the Earth lots of times, and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait. __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions, you could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future. __eou__
Where did you go yesterday? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park. __eou__ How often do you play tennis? __eou__ Twice a week. How about you? __eou__ I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball. __eou__ But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together. __eou__ I usually play with my schoolmates. __eou__ Do you like watching football matches? __eou__ Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday. __eou__ Oh, I watched it on television. It was an exciting match. __eou__
Where is your native place? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai, which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city. __eou__ So are you a local? __eou__ Yes, I am a local resident. __eou__
What're you doing now? __eou__ I'm watching TV. __eou__ You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed. __eou__ I will. __eou__ And don't ever forget it. __eou__
How can I help you today, Alice? __eou__ Well, I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship. __eou__ Oh, good. You're an excellent student. I'd be very willing to help you with that. __eou__ Thanks. I really appreciate it.In fact, I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship. __eou__ What kind of scholarship is it? __eou__ It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association. I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American. __eou__ Fine. I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year, and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher. __eou__ I'm a junior now, and my GPA is 3.92. __eou__ Excellent. So you'll have a good chance of getting it. __eou__ Well, I hope so. The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too. __eou__ Do you have an essay you want to send them? __eou__ No, they want a special essay. I must write an essay on a particular question they pose. __eou__ What is the question? __eou__ They give applicants a topic.The topic is, The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced. __eou__ That's a pretty short essay. __eou__ Yes, but I need to write it by next week. __eou__ Good luck. I'm sure you will do a good job. __eou__ I came here today to talk to you because... Well, I need to ask two favors. __eou__ Sure. What are they? __eou__ First, I need a letter of recommendation. __eou__ I'd be happy to write one for you. __eou__ And second... Well, I'm not sure if it's normal. __eou__ What is it? Do you want me to read your essay? __eou__ Yes, if you could. I mean, if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions. __eou__ Of course I could read it. That's no problem. But you need to get it to me soon. __eou__ I will. I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning. __eou__ Alright. If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning, I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend. __eou__ That would really help me a lot. I'm very grateful. __eou__ Don't mention it. I'm always willing to help good students. __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero. __eou__ It was so cold this morning. I could hardly start my car. __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first. __eou__ Don't you have a garage? __eou__ Not in the new apartment. We have to leave the car in the parking lot. __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then? You must have to keep it well below zero. __eou__ I do. Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero. __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here? __eou__ Not really. It sometimes gets to 20 below. __eou__ Speaking of cold, how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up. __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel? Aren't the programs awful? __eou__ I quite agree with you. They are terrible. They are complete waste of time, but my wife disagrees with me. __eou__ Actually, what bothers me is the violence. There are far too many detective and police shows. __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more. There aren't enough educational programs, and even the news shows are not well done. __eou__ You are absolutely right. They are too brief. They don't tell you anything. __eou__
What's the matter with you, Paul? __eou__ I'm not feeling well. I think I'm having a cold. __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest. __eou__ Yeah, I will. __eou__
You look pale today. __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning. __eou__ You should do sports to keep young. __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age, but exercise may delay it. __eou__
Steven, have you any friend in London? __eou__ Yes, my old friend Hanson lives there __eou__ Are you close? __eou__ Yes. He's one of my best friends. Our friendship formed at college. Why did you ask that? __eou__ I'm going to London on business next week. But I know nothing about it. __eou__ I get it. You want to find a guide, don't you? __eou__ Yes, Steven. You always know what I want. __eou__ Don't worry. I will call Hanson, and ask him to help you. __eou__ Thank you! __eou__
My word, you do look ill! __eou__ I'm quite out of thoughts recently. __eou__ You seem to have something on mind. Promise me, go to see the doctor right now. __eou__ I'm worrying about my exam. __eou__ A piece of cake. You'll be successful. __eou__
Excuse me, you look familiar. Did you use to live in New York? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Did you use to work at NYU? __eou__ Yes, I did. __eou__ Oh, did you know Hugh Young? He was a music student. __eou__ Hugh Young? Didn't he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time? __eou__ Yes. And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university. __eou__ I remember Hugh. Most people thought he was a little... uh... peculiar. Do you know what he's doing now? __eou__ Yes, he's a millionaire in Houston now. __eou__ A millionaire? As a jazz musician? __eou__ Oh, no. He's an executive for a large computer company. I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday. They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers. __eou__ Well! I guess people don't find him so peculiar anymore. __eou__
You look so happy, Anna. Any good news? __eou__ Yes. I'Ve won the first prize in the math contest. __eou__ Really?

Just call me Jason. __eou__ Ok, Jason. So how was the flight? __eou__ Pretty good. There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad. The worst thing was the guy behind me. He snored all through the night! __eou__ Really? But you were in first class! Nobody woke that guy up? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason. __eou__ That's terrible! So you didn't get any sleep? __eou__ Not much... but that's ok... I'm a night owl anyway. __eou__ So, aside from visiting our factory and offices, are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall. __eou__ That's not a problem. We can have a company car take you there. It's only about a two hour drive. __eou__
What are you going to do after you return from Washington? __eou__ I'm going to stay in the city. __eou__ What will you do all day? __eou__ I'm going to work with my father at the store.

I'll see you in September. __eou__

Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue. __eou__ I don't think so. Did you ever go and look at your stamp? __eou__ And let them ruin my life? Forget it! __eou__ But you've been looking for that stamp for years. __eou__ It's not worth it. Besides, I have to save up to pay for some bills. __eou__ Bummer. I guess we're both out of luck. __eou__ Yeah. Well, I'll see you this weekend. __eou__
Kate, what do you like to do tonight? Do you often go to the movies? __eou__ Of course.

It starts at 8 o'clock. __eou__ Wonderful. I'm so excited. __eou__
I feel confused by all the diet options out there. I don't know which one actually works. __eou__ Most of them are not so practical. It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended. I think making an exercise plan can be more effective. __eou__ Maybe you're right. It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center. I'd better join in a fitness club. __eou__ You don't need to lose weight, you are not fat. __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up. __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today. __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals? __eou__ Almost. There are a lot of polar animals sea birds, such as seals, whales and penguins, People don't get much chance of seeing them. __eou__ It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds. __eou__ Absolutely. To be frank, I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas. I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days. __eou__ Maybe you should let me know about your plan. I want to take my kids there some day. too. __eou__
How time flies! __eou__ May and Danny have already grown up. __eou__ I can still remember our first date. __eou__ Look at that big tree over there. __eou__ Yeah, oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there. __eou__ Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight. __eou__ You were dull at that time. __eou__ But you agreed to go out with me at last. __eou__ I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married. __eou__
I can't wait to retire. __eou__ And then what? __eou__ And then I'm moving to Florida where I can play golf all day, every day! __eou__ That sounds boring to me. __eou__ What do you plan on doing after you retire? __eou__ Yes, I think I will do something new. I'Ve always wanted to be a teacher. __eou__ I admire your energy, Ruth. You are young at heart. __eou__
Let's get together this weekend, is that all right? __eou__ Sounds good, when? __eou__ When is it convenient for you? __eou__ Any time is fine. __eou__ Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock? __eou__ Please wait for us even if we're a little late. __eou__ Never mind. I'll be waiting for you. __eou__ See you then. __eou__ OK. Bye! __eou__
I wonder if I can ask you a question. __eou__ Ask me a question? What do you want to know? __eou__ Well... er... it is just... just that I... __eou__ Just what? Stop beating around the bush. Tell me what you want to know. __eou__ I... er... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks. __eou__ Lend you a few bucks? No way! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time? __eou__ Yeah. But I... __eou__
Hey, Mary, nice to see you again. I heard you're going back home to the U. S. __eou__ Yes. I'm leaving tomorrow. I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you. __eou__ You're so thoughtful. Wish you a good trip home. And we'll miss you. __eou__ I'll miss you too, my friends. __eou__
Lovely day, isn't it? __eou__ Oh, yes. Beautiful. __eou__ You are not English, are you? __eou__ No, I am from France. __eou__
Good afternoon, would you mind if I sat here? __eou__ Of course not. __eou__ I'm Jack. What's your name? __eou__ Laura. __eou__ Do you like this place? __eou__ I don't think it's very nice. And my father doesn't like it. But my mother likes it very much. So we often come here. __eou__ How often? __eou__ Well, we come here almost every month. __eou__ Who's that? __eou__ It's my mother. She's fond of swimming. And the man beside her is my father. __eou__ Do you like swimming? __eou__ No, I hate swimming. I prefer playing tennis. __eou__
What's the area of your country? __eou__ It's not very big. It's a little over half a million square kilometers. __eou__ That sounds quite big! How many people live there? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country. Most of them live in the north. __eou__ What's the average income? __eou__ That's the really hard to say. I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month, if you convert the money from our currency into dollars. __eou__ So your country is fairly rich. __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries, but not as rich as countries in western Europe. Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment, which is roughly 8 %. It has doubled over the last four years. __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that. __eou__
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft. Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories? __eou__ I'Ve often wondered the same thing. I also wonder who reads them. Then I realize that I'm standing here reading them myself. __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them, or at least looks at the headlines. __eou__ I think we picked the right line. This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others. __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food. __eou__ I'm glad. We have only about twenty things here, and I'm in a hurry to get home. __eou__
The answer is zero! What a let-down! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee. __eou__ No hard feelings. After all, he is a child. __eou__ If you say so! __eou__
Hi. __eou__ Hi, Mary, Hi, Ken I hate to bring this up, but that new stereo, system you got... __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ You were playing it very late last night. __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ It kept me awake. __eou__ Oh, I'm sorry. __eou__ It kept me awake a couple of hours. __eou__ I'm so sorry, I.. I didn't realize it was that loud. __eou__ It was that loud, and it was pretty late, and check with Mary if you don't believe me. __eou__ It's true.It was a bit loud. __eou__ I'm very sorry. I didn't realize it. I promise I'll keep it down in the future. __eou__ Oh, it's no problem.It's OK.You know, it only happened once. __eou__ I am glad we've straightened everything out. __eou__
My mother likes to split hairs. __eou__ What do you mean by that? __eou__ She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper. __eou__ Mothers like that. __eou__
Hey Bob. Whatchy doing? __eou__ I'm at home painting. __eou__ I didn't know you paint. What type of painting is it? __eou__ I enjoy oil painting. I learned it in one of my extra classes in college. __eou__ That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby. __eou__ Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it. __eou__ I think I will. Thanks for the info. __eou__
What does your friend Jim do? __eou__ He is a teacher, but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time. __eou__ He can repair cares? I cannot believe it. __eou__ Believe me, he is the first-class. __eou__
Hey Jane. How are you doing these days? __eou__ Hi Martha. Everything is perfect. __eou__ Are you enjoying married life? __eou__ It couldn't be better. My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much. __eou__ You're so lucky. I hope to get married to a guy like that. __eou__ I'm so happy. Even though we are both working, we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends. __eou__ Do you guys do anything special? __eou__ In the evening, we just sit and talk over dinner. But on the weekend, we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant, or go to a nice cafe. __eou__ Sound like everything is great. __eou__
David, why don't you clean your room? __eou__ I am not in the mood. __eou__ Why are you feeling depress? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. It's a real letdown. __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing. __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed. __eou__ Oh, cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything. __eou__ But she means a lot to me. __eou__ Then forgive her mistake. __eou__ Oh, I just can't forget it. __eou__
My brother joined the army last year. __eou__ Oh, what does he look like? Is he tall? __eou__ He's tall and strong. __eou__ I can tell it from your build. __eou__
Look, Forest Gump is on at six thirty. __eou__ Really? It was on in 1994 for the first time. And it is really a classic. __eou__ Yeah, I am very impressed with Tom Hanks'performance in the movie. __eou__ I am also impressed with the lines in the movie. __eou__ Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. __eou__ That's my favorite. __eou__ You know, it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995. Unbelievable! __eou__ It deserves. That film can give us a lot of inspiration. __eou__ Yes, the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble. __eou__ All in all, it will never lose its appeal. __eou__ Gucci, I have an idea. Do you want to see this movie together? __eou__ Sure. Now you are talking. __eou__
I hate this kind of weather! __eou__ When I was a kid, there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather. __eou__ I think he had water on the brain. This is bad. __eou__ He said there are only all kinds of good weather. __eou__ Okay, Pollyanna, what's so good about this weather? __eou__ Well, for one, we have an excuse to stay home. __eou__ We'get'to stay home? Do you know something that I don't? __eou__ I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us. __eou__

What are you reading? __eou__ Oh, it's the latest novel by ray blue. It's a sic-fi thriller. __eou__ I thought he usually wrote horror books. __eou__ He does. He's good at this genre too. It's a captivating read. __eou__ We're going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us? __eou__ Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, as you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks. __eou__ Me too. I need something to read on the flight to new york. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children's books for her daughter. __eou__ I want to look at nelson Mandela's autobiography. __eou__ This is sure to be a worthwhile read. __eou__
Do you know what the BBS is? __eou__ Sure. __eou__ Tell me then. __eou__ BBS means Bulletin Board Service. __eou__ Oh, I see, but what's it used for? __eou__ A lot of things! __eou__ Tell me in details. __eou__ Okay. BBS, an online service, offers a wide variety of online games, files, one-on-one chat, message areas, private mail, and participate forums. __eou__ Oh, that's great. I want to try later. __eou__ Why not? __eou__
Any plans tonight? __eou__ Not really, do you? __eou__ Well, I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something. You know, I just came back from a really tough interview. I was quite nervous during the interview. I really want to have the job. Right now, I am still a little on the edge. I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview. __eou__ Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, anyway? __eou__ I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me. __eou__ That's strange. But probably, it is the new interview technique they call it'Getting to know you more personally'. What about your answers? __eou__ Just did my best. __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I need to return these books. __eou__ What happened to this one? __eou__ The cover came off. __eou__ You're going to need to pay for the damage. __eou__ How much are you talking? __eou__ It's going to be $ 5. __eou__ That's not bad at all. __eou__ It really isn't. __eou__ Here you go. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__ You're welcome. Have a nice day. __eou__
When it comes to select a fund, you will always read "Past performance is not an indication of future results", can you believe that? __eou__ Maybe it is right since everything is possible. You know the market changes quickly these days. But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance. For me, his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy. I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns. __eou__ But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance. For me, his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy. I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns. __eou__ If you refuse to take risk, you can't have better returns. __eou__ I will think about it. __eou__
I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham. Is there really anything so fascinating with him? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ You mean he plays well? Yeah, he often scores by free kicks in crucial games. But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks. __eou__ Certainly not. What really counts is to play as a team, passing the ball amongst each other, dodging defenders. Free kicks are a result of all the teammates'collective efforts.However, a few free kicks often make everything different, especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time. __eou__ In the case, maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, the majority of his fans are girls. __eou__ Yes, his face looks are manly, with a straight nose and infinite eyes. As a man of medium height in the West, he keeps a powerful but elegant figure, looking neither lanky nor stout. __eou__ And he is English! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent. __eou__
Can you tell which team seems to win? __eou__ Hard to say. Now the score is in our favor. __eou__ Yes. Our guest team is really tough. __eou__ They're still fighting hard. Let's wait and see. __eou__
May I have a word with you? __eou__ Certainly. __eou__ When will you be free? __eou__ Come by any time. __eou__ Shall I say around ten o'clock? __eou__ Yes, I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00. __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age. It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier. __eou__ Fully agree. I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel. The latest office equipment is more type-functional. It combines fax machine, copy machine and printer in one. It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three. __eou__ Yes, this machine is even smaller than those before. __eou__ When will we get one of those? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny. We have to use up the equipment first. __eou__
Congratulations! Mr. Stuart! You won the city marathon. __eou__ Thank you. I am very excited. __eou__ We are all very proud of you. __eou__ I am very happy, too. It was a big game and I won. __eou__ I watched the race with my children. We saw you run to the finish line. We all screamed with excitement. __eou__ It was really an exciting moment. __eou__
I really dislike reading academic books. __eou__ That may be so, but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge. __eou__
Are you ok, Chuck? You look pale. __eou__ I'm fine, Katherine. I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese. __eou__ Oh, poor you. You know what? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well. __eou__ You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it, but I've made little progress! __eou__ Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs. __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs? __eou__ You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now. __eou__ That's a real achievement. How did you do that? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer. __eou__ It makes sense. __eou__ It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow. __eou__ Can Join you, Katherine? I do want to have a try. __eou__ Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now. __eou__ Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary? __eou__ Yes, just in case we run into me new characters. __eou__ Ok. I will bring it with me. __eou__
Where to, miss? __eou__ Hi! Crenshaw and Hawthorne, at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner. __eou__ Sure thing. So, where are you flying in from? __eou__ From China. __eou__ Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so. __eou__ It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products. __eou__ Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you? __eou__ Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age? __eou__ Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas! __eou__ Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U. S of A, although I have some Colombian heritage. __eou__ Really? That's great! Do you speak some Spanish? __eou__ Uh... yeah.. of course! __eou__ Que bien! Sentences poems habeas en espanol! __eou__
Oh, boy, I hate to say this, but I really have to leave now. __eou__ That's all right. I understand. __eou__ I'm so sorry. __eou__ That's ok. Don't be sorry. We'll talk later. __eou__
Have you thought of moving at all, Sarah? __eou__ We'Ve thought about it, but my husband and I can't afford it right now. The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums, which is something I don't want to do. __eou__ Buying a house can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ Well, sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community. You'd have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, but you would definitely save money doing it that way. __eou__ That's a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before? __eou__ Sure, my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They're pretty satisfied with it. __eou__ Is the house pretty run-down. __eou__ Not at all. The woman, who owned it, took good care of it. But when she died, she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her. __eou__ Was it a very old house? __eou__ It was about 75 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing, but it didn't take a lot of money or time. __eou__ Is it in a good location? __eou__ The area can be a bit rough in the evenings, but the neighbors watch out for each other, so it's ok. __eou__
Do Mona and Jim need a new house? __eou__ No, they have a big new fancy house. __eou__ Does Jim make a lot of money? __eou__ Yes, he does. He is a science fiction writer. __eou__ Does Jim need to make more money? __eou__ Afraid so. The more the better. __eou__ What do they need all that money for? __eou__ Well, they spend it pretty quick. New clothes, new computers and new cars every year. And they'Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress, she likes to spend a lot of money. __eou__ Do they have any children? __eou__ No. They want children but no luck yet. __eou__ What does Jim like to do? __eou__ Jim likes to travel around the world.That's expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money. __eou__ What does Mona like to do? __eou__ Oh, she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, and she has quite a bit of jewelry. __eou__ Wow... She sounds like a high maintenance wife. __eou__ I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government. __eou__ Politics can be an expensive hobby. __eou__ She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps. __eou__ Politics is a hard game to play. __eou__ She might do well. Everyone seems to like her. __eou__
Are you alright, child? __eou__ Hey, I still know my name. __eou__ What did the nurse say? __eou__ She said I have a fever but nothing major. __eou__ In that case, you should go home and get plenty of rest. __eou__ What if this small fever turns into a big fever? __eou__ Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you. __eou__
Who was the best teacher that you ever had? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler, my fourth grade teacher. __eou__ What was she like? __eou__ She was patient, kind, fun, smart, caring, and yet strict, too. I really learned a lot from her. __eou__ What kind of things did you learn? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do. __eou__ Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it. __eou__ You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, the students had to treat each other with respect, or they would be disciplined. __eou__ I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students. __eou__ Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don't have any teacher's pets. __eou__ Really? Doesn't every teacher have a teacher's pet? __eou__ Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn't treat me any differently. She really didn't have any teacher's pets. __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now? __eou__ As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, she got married and moved to another city. Then, she started writing children's book. __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books? __eou__ Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books. __eou__ Why don't you recommend one to me? __eou__ ok! I'll bring one to you next time. __eou__
Mum, this is for you. __eou__ Oh, flowers! What for, my dear? __eou__ Happy Mother's Day to you, Mum! __eou__ Oh, thank you.You are so sweet! __eou__
Did you like the party? __eou__ Not particularly. I was rather disappointed. __eou__ Why? What had you expected? __eou__ I'd expected it to be much more exciting. __eou__
Look, daddy is on again. Don't you think he is handsome? __eou__ To some extent, he is. And what do you think we move to a better place? I can't see him clearly from here. __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great, but they're already occupied by somebody else. __eou__ Oh, thank you for pointing that out. By the way, have you been following NBA for this season? __eou__ Of course, tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game. __eou__ Who plays who? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers. Yao Ming, my idol, will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience. __eou__ It's amazing. And when did he begin to play in the NBA? __eou__ In 2002. And since then he has attracted more attention than ever. __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more. I know he is very tall. __eou__ Oh, you know something. He is 2.26 meters tall. But he is also nimble and skillful. __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game. __eou__ Yes, what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game. __eou__ That's really terrible. Oh, God, we forgot to cheer for Daddy. __eou__ Never mind. After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming, right? __eou__ You are always so naughty. __eou__
Pretty! Say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. __eou__ Such an eye! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant! Regular features, open countenance, with a complexion, Oh! What a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being'the picture of health'; now, she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. __eou__
Is that Mr. Green? __eou__ This is him speaking. __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us. Welcome aboard, I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto, ways of teaching, etc. __eou__ Yes. I am very glad to have the chance. __eou__
I'm so nervous about this oral test. __eou__ Just calm down. I'm sure you'll do well. __eou__ I just want to get it over with. __eou__
I hear you're taking a music class. I didn't know you're interested in it. __eou__ Oh, I'm not. I'Ve never had a music class before. __eou__ In my opinion, you'll make it. __eou__ You're having me on again. __eou__ No, I'm serious. __eou__
What's the date today? __eou__ December the fifteenth. The day after tomorrow is little Tom's birthday. __eou__ Right. What present should we give him this time? By the way, how old is he? __eou__ Thirteen today and tomorrow. Fourteen the day after tomorrow. __eou__ How time flies! He's a big boy now. __eou__ And don't forget Mary, Tom's twin sister. It's her birthday, too. __eou__ OK. Let's invite all their little friends to come and celebrate. __eou__
Peter and Mary broke up. __eou__ Are you serious? __eou__
I had a wonderful evening. __eou__ I did, too.Come and visit us again, will you? __eou__ I will. __eou__
Do you know Sally? __eou__ Sally? She is a bachelor girl. She is an excellent designer. Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains. __eou__ Why is she still single? She must have a face that would stop a clock. __eou__ Oh, quite the other way round. She is a knock-out. She devotes much of her time to her career. __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally? __eou__ No, what? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital. __eou__ Why? __eou__ She passed out in class. Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days. __eou__ Why on earth would she do that? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days? That's crazy! __eou__ Yeah, but that's what she did. __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies. And all for a certain look. __eou__ Well, it's not just the girl's fault. It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying, It's in to be thin. It's hard for them not to listen. __eou__ True, but there are limits. Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another. No one forces them to do this. __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom's attitude? __eou__ I'Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny's brother. But he likes Jenny. She is a big apple in his eye. __eou__ Love me, love my dog. He's a sensible kind man. __eou__ That's why many people look up to him. __eou__
Have you found another job yet, Sally? __eou__ No, I haven't, but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper. __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel. __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields. __eou__ I know.But I'd like to try.Look, here are some advertisements that I've cut out. __eou__
Hi. Are you new in this class? __eou__ Yes, I am. I really don't know anyone. __eou__ My name is Steven. What's your name? __eou__ My name is Bill. How are your lessons going? __eou__ Very well. And my favorite subject is Chinese. __eou__ I prefer to learn English. In my opinion, English is easier than Chinese. __eou__ I guess English has fewer characters. __eou__ You are right. __eou__
Robert, this is my friend, Mrs. Smith. __eou__ Hi, Nice to meet you. __eou__ Nice to meet you too. __eou__ Mrs. Smith, what do you do for work? __eou__ I'm a doctor. __eou__ Oh. Where do you work? __eou__ New York University hospital in New York City. What do you do? __eou__ I'm a teacher. __eou__ What do you teach? __eou__ I teach English. __eou__ Where? __eou__ At a high school in New Jersey. __eou__ That's nice. How old are you? __eou__ I'm 32. __eou__
Hah! For three hours while you threw up. And Femi dumped me for that. I really loved her. __eou__ I'm so sorry, Taylor. Go talk to her. I'm sure she'd be happy to see you. __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me. She's probably married. __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you. So get out there, Tiger! __eou__ Was she really? So you're telling me there's a chance? __eou__ Can't hurt to try. Carpe diem. Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not? __eou__
Oh, Ralph, I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space. Disasters have happened before. If the spaceship were out of order... __eou__ You should be optimistic about this. Things have taken a good turn. You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible. __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors? __eou__ It's once in blue moon. __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space? __eou__ The main one is radiation. There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space. The first is radiation from the sun, and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface. The second, less harmful, comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts. __eou__
Hi, Mark, did you catch the game last night? __eou__ No, I was out. Was it worth watching? __eou__ You didn't hear? Spain won, two to zero. __eou__ Oh, really? So, Spain is through to the next round? __eou__ Yeah. The final is next week. You have to watch it. __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work. What a life! I've had enough of it. __eou__ Cool down, man. Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic. But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. __eou__ What should I do then? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour. __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, polled air on the road? __eou__ Well, such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing. I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable. You just sit there in a daze, gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? Enjoy the speed on the road. Just think, you are flashing past the poles with your own energy. How great! __eou__
How many people are there in your family? __eou__ Five. Besides my parents and me, there are my brother and sister. __eou__ That's a big family. How old is your brother? __eou__ Eighteen. __eou__ What about your sister? __eou__ She's not quite twenty-five. __eou__ Do you miss your family? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Do you often go home? __eou__ No. But I often send e-mail to them. And make a call to my parents regularly. __eou__ How often do you call to them? __eou__ Once a week. __eou__
I'm terribly nervous. __eou__ Calm down! __eou__
What's wrong? You don't like ancient Egypt? __eou__ Actually, I don't like history. Lately, these shows are always about the Pyramids. __eou__ The Pyramids are amazing! Millions of gigantic stones... each one perfect... __eou__ And nobody knows who built them, right? It's a total mystery! __eou__ You sound like the TV! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids, are you? __eou__
What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps. __eou__ I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated. __eou__ Come on, nothing can be that bad. __eou__ But promise me, you'll keep it a secret. __eou__ Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss. __eou__ Really? Is he married? __eou__ Bo, of course not. He is still single. __eou__ Then what's your problem? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us. __eou__ Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip. __eou__ Worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days. __eou__ Office romance is very tricky. __eou__ It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed. __eou__ Cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine. __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I want to return this video. __eou__ Is that all you need? __eou__ I also need to check these books out. __eou__ Anything else? __eou__ That's everything. __eou__ I need your library card. __eou__ I have it. Here you go. __eou__ Do you need anything else? __eou__ That's everything. __eou__ Your books are due back two weeks from today. __eou__ Thank you. Good night. __eou__
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday? __eou__ I did. Let me go get it for you. Here you go. __eou__ Thanks so much. __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish. __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries. __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary? __eou__ It says that traditionally, give something made of paper. __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper  stationery and money. __eou__
I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys. __eou__ But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon. __eou__ Yeah, but that was before the guys ask me to join the team. __eou__ So what? __eou__ You know how much I want to be on the team, and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They'll get someone else and I'll miss my chance. __eou__ I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, and I did. __eou__ I know, and I will. __eou__ When? __eou__ After baseball practice. __eou__ And then, it'll be dinner time, then homework, and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise. __eou__ No, I won't. I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you. __eou__ Well, I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game, it's ok with me. __eou__ No problem, I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks. __eou__
What stresses you out the most? __eou__ Probably my parents. __eou__ How so? __eou__ Well, during school, they wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job. And finally, they want me to get married. __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents. __eou__ Your parents are not like that? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much. __eou__ You're lucky. __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress? __eou__ Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, but that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning. __eou__ That sucks. You wanna go grab a beer? __eou__ Sure. Sounds great. Let's go. __eou__
Tony looks very handsome in the suit. __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets. __eou__ Judge from his look, he's a very serious person. __eou__ As a matter of fact, he is. __eou__
Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married. __eou__ She must be a good wife. __eou__ Not necessarily. This is only what she says, not what she does. __eou__ I see. __eou__
What's the weather like? __eou__ I don't know. I just woke up. __eou__ Why don't you look outside? __eou__ Okay. It looks like rain. __eou__ Why do you say that? __eou__ The sky is gray. __eou__ Is it raining right now? __eou__ No. __eou__ How do you know? __eou__ The street isn't wet. __eou__ I have to go shopping today. __eou__ You'd better take an umbrella. __eou__
Hey there, you look a little lost. Are you new here? __eou__ Yeah how'd you know? __eou__ You can always spot the newbies. I can give you a few pointers if you want. Were you trying to use this machine here? __eou__ Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where to begin. __eou__ It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition? __eou__ Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio. __eou__ In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle. __eou__ Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a lot of weight! __eou__ It's not that much. Just watch... I'm ok... __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son, who fools around without working. __eou__ He's out of John's hands. Nothing he can do about such a black sheep. __eou__ If I were him, I would give him a good talking-to. I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that. __eou__
Do you like ice skating? __eou__ I have never tried it. __eou__ Then you've got to try it. Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday. __eou__ Sorry, I don't think I can. __eou__ Friday then. How about it? __eou__ Friday is great. __eou__ It's settled then. __eou__
Gordon, you're ever so late. __eou__ Yes, I am sorry. I missed the bus. __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes, and you are over 1 hour late. __eou__ Well, I missed several buses. __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses? __eou__ I, ah..., I got have late. __eou__ Oh, come on, Gordon, it's the afternoon now. Why were you late really? __eou__ Well, I... I lost my wallet, and I... __eou__ Have you got it now? __eou__ Yes, I found it again. __eou__ When? __eou__ This morning. I mean... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation. __eou__
Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it. __eou__ Oh, Goodness, please not again.That's what we did last week. __eou__ No, we didn't. Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness. __eou__ Right, it was a chick flick, just like this one, so what's the difference? Besides, this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen. Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen. __eou__ Oh, yeah, and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie, didn't you? __eou__ Oh, sure, it was great. I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap. __eou__ It wasn't that bad, and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant. __eou__ That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much. __eou__ And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken. __eou__ But when I pick the restaurant, we go to a place that has both chicken and fish. I always respect your food preferences. __eou__ Well, I suppose that, to be fair, you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat. __eou__ Now you're talking, we can see that love story next time. __eou__
How's your new job going? __eou__ Really well, thanks. __eou__ How are you finding your new boss? __eou__ She's not bad. She's a bit bossy, but I'm sure I'll get used to her. __eou__ Would you rather have her or your old boss back? __eou__ She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down. __eou__ How about your new co-workers? __eou__ They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work. __eou__ Do you miss your old co-workers? __eou__ Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me. __eou__ Do people in different departments get along with each other? __eou__ Sure. Since we work together in teams, we have to get along with each other. __eou__ Do you like working in teams with people from different departments? __eou__ Yes, it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives. __eou__ Do you like working in teams? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently. I think most people do. __eou__
Linda, John and I are going to get married next week. __eou__ That's wonderful. Congratulations. __eou__ Thank you, Linda. We would love you to come to our wedding. __eou__ I'd love to. What date is it? __eou__ It's May 1st. __eou__ What day is that? __eou__ It's Saturday. Could you make the time? __eou__ Yes, sure. What time will the wedding begin? __eou__ At nine sharp. __eou__ Very good! I'm looking forward to it. Please give my best regards to John. And I wish you best luck! __eou__ Thanks. __eou__
So do you think you can get to the office alone? __eou__ Sure, I'll catch the train. If I can't catch the train, I'll get a taxi. __eou__ Do you think the taxi driver will understand you? __eou__ If he doesn't understand me, I'll show him the office address on my business card. __eou__ Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late? __eou__ I'll call you if I'm delayed. __eou__
You and Bob have finished? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Are you going to be okay? __eou__ Yes, I'm used to being on my own. __eou__
Tony looks very handsome in the suit. __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets. __eou__ Judge from his look, he's a very serious person. __eou__ As a matter of fact, he is. __eou__
You are friend of Janet, right? I am Andrew, Andrew Smith. __eou__ Nice to meet you, Andrew. I am Noirin, Noirin O'Neil. __eou__ I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. __eou__ Noirin, N-O-I-R-I-N, it's an Irish name. __eou__
Wow! It's packed. __eou__ The train station is indeed crowded. I think it's hard for us to get on the train. __eou__
it's getting cold. __eou__ yes. I bought a scarf yesterday. It's really nice and warm. Have a look. __eou__ Oh, it's made of wool. I like the striped pattern. __eou__ yes, I adore simple fashions. How does it look on me? __eou__ it looks great, but you need something to go with it. It's too plain on its own. __eou__ how about this blue sweater? __eou__ that's a good idea. When did you buy it? Is it a name brand? __eou__ yes, but I bought it when it was on sale, 50 % off the original price. OK, what do you think? __eou__ that looks lovely. Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings. __eou__ I've got a pair of pearl earrings. Here it is. __eou__ perfect! __eou__ you have good fashion sense, Karen. __eou__ thanks. We should be ourselves. There are so many fashion victims out there. __eou__ yes, but with our sense we'll always look good. __eou__
Susan? What brings you here today? __eou__ Well, I'Ve got some papers due. __eou__ Really? So what's the news? __eou__ Not too good yet. Better than I was though. __eou__
Hello, Mary. __eou__ Hello, Brian. __eou__ Here is my friend Bob. __eou__ Hello, Bob. __eou__
Are you free tonight? __eou__ Depends. __eou__
Wanna chill out and watch cable? __eou__ Wow! Besides The Cosby Show, I've never seen a black sitcom. What's this program? __eou__ It's a drama called Soul Food. This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television. It has black shows, news and commercials. __eou__ This show is like a black Friends. __eou__ BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV. __eou__ That's cool. I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable. __eou__
My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today. Can you guess why? __eou__ He isn't a man of good taste for clothes, is he? __eou__ He is, but I didn't mean that. His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift, and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office. __eou__ It must be hard being a father. __eou__ No, it's great being a father, seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you. __eou__ Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day. __eou__
So Alex, you're off to the Olympic stadium then? __eou__ Yes, I should get there just in time for the women's 400m relay. __eou__ Wow, that should be really exciting, especially with so many famous athletes there. __eou__ Yes, I'm also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump. __eou__ Well have a good time.

I am having a hard time at my job. __eou__ What's wrong, Julia? __eou__ My colleagues quickly get promotions, while I always get sidelined. I don't know what to do anymore. __eou__ Don't give up so soon. __eou__ But I don't know what else I can do. I am willing to work hard.

Never give up on your dream. __eou__

Harry, do you like the opera? __eou__ No, not really. __eou__ Why is that? It is called real art. __eou__ Well, it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language. That kind of gets on my nerves. __eou__ Yeah, that makes sense. __eou__

Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips? __eou__ No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder. __eou__

I hear you're entering the speech contest, Mike. __eou__ That's right. I thought I'd give it a shot. __eou__ Well, I wish you good luck! __eou__
What shall we do after the volleyball match? __eou__ How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look? I remember there is one in the gym. __eou__ That's a good idea. I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family. __eou__ Me, too. What did you have in mind? __eou__ I haven't decided yet, but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must. __eou__ I agree. They're very lovely, especially Huanhuan __eou__ Is that the red one? That is my favorite, too. Do you know how much they are? __eou__ The five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive. __eou__ Oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, can I get any discount? __eou__ I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now. __eou__ Any other ideas? __eou__ There are lots of things, such as postcards, key chains, posters and various arts and crafts. __eou__ It all sounds great. We can go there after the match. I can't wait to see what they have. __eou__
It is time to butter him up. __eou__ What do you have to do to grease the palm of him? __eou__ I don't know. Let me see. __eou__ You can go and ask your father. __eou__

Who's that old lady trimming the trees? __eou__ She's my grandma. __eou__ She looks very healthy.How old is she? __eou__ 92. __eou__
What do you think are the main causes of war today? __eou__ I'd say the main reason is poverty. Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little. If their neighbors have some resources, they try to steal them by military force. __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars. People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country. __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end. __eou__ How do you think they could be ended? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that. __eou__ So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them. __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it's harder to make peace between countries. __eou__ Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive. __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer. __eou__
Are you feeling better today, Bill? __eou__ Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. __eou__ You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. __eou__ You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit. __eou__ But you should make up your mind first. __eou__ You know, I often have to work til late at night. I need something to keep me awake. __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work. __eou__ Thank you for your advice! I'll try it. __eou__
Well, I must be off now. I have an appointment at six. __eou__ In that case, I won't keep you any longer. Drop in any time. __eou__ Ok. Goodbye. __eou__ See you later. __eou__
Hello, Julia, I know a party that will begin at midnight. Would you love to go? __eou__ I'd love to, but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night. She will worry if I get home late. __eou__ What a pity! The party is very interesting. __eou__ I have no choice. My mother is always very strict with me. __eou__ Don't complain about it. She is concerned about your safety. __eou__ You're right. Mother's love is the greatest love in the world. __eou__
Steven, why are you so depressed? __eou__ I'm feeling very sad. I just read the newspaper. __eou__ What's the news? __eou__ According to the newspaper, the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake. __eou__ It's horrible. __eou__ Yeah, we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area. __eou__ Yes. How about donating some money? __eou__ It's a good idea. But where can we donate money? __eou__ Just find the answer through Internet. __eou__ Yes, let's do it now. __eou__
I don't know how to deal with Jack. He is indeed a trouble maker. He has louse up my business several times. __eou__ You mean Lily's boyfriend? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ Well, he is a hard case. Everyone would feel headache about him. __eou__
Who's that over here? __eou__ That's the new teacher. __eou__ What do you think of the teacher? __eou__ She's very nice. __eou__ What does she teach? __eou__ English, of course. __eou__ Is she your teacher? __eou__ Yes.She teaches our class three times a week. __eou__ Can she speak Chinese to her students? __eou__ Not very much. __eou__ It's a good thing you can speak English! __eou__
Judy, what is everybody talking about? __eou__ Haven't you heard? Richard was fired by our manager. __eou__ You're kidding. It can't be true. __eou__ Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company. __eou__ Really? I'm surprised. __eou__ Me too. __eou__
Hi, Mike. Haven't seen you for a while. How's Cathy? __eou__ We are not seeing each other any more. __eou__ What happened? Did you break up? __eou__ Yeah. I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time. __eou__ Oh, I am sorry. Maybe you were just emotional at that moment. Do you think you guys can get back together? __eou__ I don't know. There's plenty of fish out there in the sea! __eou__ Oh, you are such a dog! __eou__
They're very good friends, aren't they? __eou__ I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other. __eou__ Oh, it's unbelievable! __eou__
I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday. It was very good. __eou__ I didn't know about it. What did you do? __eou__ We ate a lot of things. We played games and gave gifts to Jessie. We had a lot of fun. __eou__ You were really lucky. __eou__ My birthday comes next month. I want to hold a birthday party, too. __eou__ I hope I can go to your party. __eou__
My friend finally dumped her boyfriend, and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry. __eou__ After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised. How's her headspace? __eou__ She's doing great, she's getting her confidence back, and her self-esteem, has improved drastically.She's very happy. __eou__ I'm proud of you for standing by her. I think you've helped make a big difference in her life. __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening? __eou__ No, why? __eou__ My friend, who had the mishap, wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her. __eou__ She doesn't need to do that, I didn't do anything. __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that. Come on, Let's indulge her. __eou__
Hey, Tom, what to go for a run? __eou__ No thanks. I like to run in the morning. I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today. __eou__ I try to do that, but I can't get up early enough. __eou__ I couldn't either at first, but you get used to it. __eou__ It's so hot at lunchtime ; I'd rather run in the morning. __eou__ Well, why don't you come tomorrow? I'll stop by your house on my way out. __eou__ I could try, but I can't say for sure if I'll get up in time. What time do you want to go? __eou__ I'll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty. __eou__ O. K., maybe if I have someone to go with, I'll be able to get up in time for a jog. __eou__ Great, I'll see you then. __eou__ See you. __eou__
How's the weather today? __eou__ It's cloudy. __eou__ Is it going to rain today? __eou__ I doubt it. __eou__ But I heard it might rain. __eou__
Well, the way you drive, Jen... I still don't think that's a good idea. __eou__ I really love this music. It's a compilation. __eou__ I know. It's a mix of all the latest songs. __eou__ And you got them off the Net? __eou__ No. I recorded these from your Cds. __eou__ Well, thanks for asking for my permission... Now hand it over and let me record! __eou__ I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy... __eou__
Um, which of them is the better typist? __eou__ Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully. __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary's short hand is the best in her class. __eou__ How about languages? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does. __eou__ Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German. __eou__
My friend George has been to Switzerland twice. __eou__ Does he like that country? __eou__ Yes, he likes the people and the quietness there. __eou__ Would you ask him to tell us more about the country? __eou__
Hello, Ann! Is that you? __eou__ Yes, it is. Hi, Tom! It's a real surprise to see you here. __eou__ It's been a long time! What's new? __eou__ Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well? __eou__ Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii. __eou__ How was it? __eou__ I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up. __eou__ Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour. __eou__ Ok, I won't keep you then. __eou__ Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye! __eou__ Yes, stay in touch. Bye! __eou__ Give me your email, would you? __eou__ Sure! It's txyb@gmail.com. __eou__
Ok... I'll talk to you later. Bye __eou__ Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down. __eou__ I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times. __eou__ Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know. __eou__ Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off. __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness. __eou__ I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know... __eou__ Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one! __eou__ You are something else you know that? __eou__
Hi, my name's Karl. My wife and I are moving in next door. __eou__ Hello, Karl. I'm Chuck Jones. We're going to be neighbors. __eou__ I'm happy to meet you. It seems everyone in town is so friendly. __eou__ This is a small town, and we like to be neighborly. We know everyone who lives around here. __eou__ Well, I'm from Chicago. There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors. __eou__ So, tell me, Karl, why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live? __eou__ We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. Another reason is, we can afford to buy a home here, but we can't in Chicago! __eou__
Look! It's the start of the Olympic Games. __eou__ So what? __eou__ You want to watch, don't you? __eou__ Not really. I couldn't careless about the Olympic Games. __eou__ Please yourself. __eou__
The question is easy for everybody.Don't you think so? __eou__ Yeah, it's very easy. But it's above Nick's head __eou__ Why do you say so? __eou__ He's always confused by easy questions. __eou__
I can't believe it! __eou__ What's wrong? That was a great goal. __eou__ Yes, but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars! __eou__ Looks like you're going to lose out on this game then. __eou__ I can't believe it! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure. __eou__ What were the odds? __eou__ 20 to 1, in favour of the Cougars! __eou__ Too bad. __eou__
Jenny, I was wondering... if you.. eh are you busy this Friday? __eou__ Yes, Friday I have a class, right after work. __eou__ Oh, what about Saturday?

Do you have plans tonight? __eou__ No, do you want to go and do something? __eou__ Yes, yes, I want to take you to dinner. __eou__ Oh, that sounds great. How about 6 o'clock? __eou__

I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuroanatomy. __eou__ Wow, you are going to be busy this semester! Okay, here you go. You are registered now. you'll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start. __eou__
Is your city a historical place? __eou__ Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. __eou__ How did it grow into such a large place? __eou__ Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre. __eou__ As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby. __eou__ Yes, it did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city. __eou__ I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city? __eou__ Oh, yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, so our city has a castle too. __eou__ Really? So your city does have some old history after all. __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners. How many foreign languages can you speak, Elizabeth? __eou__ Two. French and Spanish. __eou__ And how well can you speak them? __eou__ Well, French was my best subject at school. I can read and write it pretty well. __eou__ And how about your Spanish? __eou__ Well, it's not as good as my French. I can speak it reasonably well, but my written Spanish isn't very good. __eou__ I see. Well, we have a lot of Spanish customers, but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here. __eou__ In that case, I'm fit for the position I think. __eou__
Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night? __eou__ Yes, of course. And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers. __eou__ You bet. The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it. __eou__
Do you mind if I get a lift in your car, please? __eou__ I don't see any problem, only the car is a bit old. __eou__ Oh you're so kind! __eou__ Get in. __eou__
Fred, can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone? __eou__ Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone. __eou__ Well, I have to provide some of my information, right? __eou__ Yep! The nick name for your zone, address, gender and so on. Some of them are privacy, so you have the right to keep secret here. __eou__ All information is filled in and now I can design my zone. __eou__ You can choose one type to make it as your background, and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it, so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone. __eou__ Now everything is OK. I can write my blog, right? __eou__ Certainly. __eou__ ( Half an hour, Janice begins shouting excitedly. ) What's the matter with you? __eou__ Look! David gives his following-comment on my first blog. He is my first visitor. __eou__
Do you remember Tina, my good friend? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ She just broke up with her boyfriend. __eou__ Well, that happens. I hope she is all right. __eou__ But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department. It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday. __eou__ That is the down side of an office romance. I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress. The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case. __eou__ Well, Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work, easier set them done. But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup. __eou__
Hi Bill, I saw your grandma yesterday. __eou__ Oh where was that? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track. __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods. __eou__ Well, it pays off for her. How old is she anyway? __eou__ She will be 86 next month. __eou__ That is truly amazing! __eou__
What time shall I pick you up? __eou__ How about 6:30? __eou__ That'll be fine. See you soon. __eou__
Hi, Zhengjun, what make you so happy. __eou__ You know what, I've just got a new job with a computer company. __eou__ Oh, congratulations! __eou__
Hi, Linda. I haven't seen you for ages. __eou__ Yes. I miss you very much. __eou__ So do I. __eou__ Have you graduated from college? __eou__ Yes. I graduated last year and got a job in a press. __eou__
Has the train come yet? __eou__ No, I'Ve been waiting for ages. __eou__ It's so unreliable. I'Ve been late for my meetings all this week. __eou__ Yes, me too. I think I'Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train! __eou__ Yes, my customers have started to complain too! __eou__ Oh look! Here it comes now! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry. __eou__ Don't worry about it. It's not new, it already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt? __eou__ No, thank you. __eou__ That's the most important thing. __eou__ It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid. __eou__ Forget about it. __eou__ When you lent me the bike, it looked brand new, almost anyway. __eou__ Maybe, but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well. __eou__ I appreciate that, thank you. __eou__
Jenny is going to marry another man next month. __eou__ Yes, I know. __eou__ But, how can you be so calm. You loved her so much. __eou__ At least I'm the one who rates with her. I'm glad we can still be friends. __eou__
What's your favorite sport? __eou__ Basketball, I'm a basketball fan. __eou__
Hello, Jane. What do you do in your spare time? __eou__ Well, nothing special, reading, watching TV, walking, and so on. __eou__ Don't you have any hobbies, like stamp collecting or things like that? __eou__ No, I don't have any hobbies. How about you? __eou__ I like collecting antiques. It's expensive, but it's a lot of fun. __eou__ Really? How many collections do you have? __eou__ So far I have more than 500 collections. __eou__ Among those collections, which is the most expensive? __eou__ A set of ancient china. It is really invaluable. __eou__
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays. __eou__ Yes. Speaking of digital wares, I bought a digital camera last week. __eou__ Cool! What brand __eou__ A Sony. It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart. __eou__ What about the quality? __eou__ Superb! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear. __eou__
It's four o'clock already. I hate to leave, but I think I must. __eou__ Can you stay a little longer? __eou__ I'm sorry, but I can't. __eou__
Can I see your parents some time tomorrow? __eou__ Sorry, they are too busy these days. __eou__ How about this weekend? __eou__ Yes, I think so. __eou__
Happy Thanksgiving! __eou__ You, too. __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie. __eou__ It's my favorite. __eou__
Are you going anywhere for your vacation? __eou__ Yes, we're making plans for a tour. __eou__ That'll be lovely. Where are you going? __eou__ Well start out from Long Island this Friday. We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City, where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday. __eou__ Well, you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then. __eou__ Oh, we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by. How does it sound, David? __eou__ It sounds good. You can do a lot of sightseeing, too. __eou__ Yes, we'll take our time. And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street. __eou__ So, you're going to have a really nice vacation. __eou__ You can say that again. __eou__
Would you like to book a table, sir? __eou__ Yes, would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow? __eou__ Sure, when? __eou__ Six o'clock in the afternoon. __eou__ For how many guests, please? __eou__ Six. __eou__ How much would you like to spend? __eou__ We don't care about money. We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties. __eou__ OK. __eou__ How many courses are there altogether, please? __eou__ Eight. __eou__ Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner? __eou__ Sure. The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices. __eou__ Very good. __eou__
Did you watch TV last night, Rose? __eou__ Yeah. I saw a science program. It was quite interesting. __eou__ What was it about? __eou__ Mars. Scientists say there might be water on it. __eou__ If so, we may live there someday. __eou__ I hope so. Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month? __eou__ Sure. I heard about this on the TV. On January 3rd, 2004, Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater. And three weeks later, Spirit's twin explorer, Opportunity, landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists. __eou__ Yes. Both have sent back pictures of the planet. And the latter did a better job. __eou__
How is your job search going, Janet? __eou__ I found the ideal position. I'm working for a plumbing company. __eou__ Are you serious? You studied mathematics at college for four years, and now you have a job working with your hands! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge, and creativity. I love this job. __eou__ I can see that. But I didn't know you had experience in that line of work. __eou__ I didn't, but I applied for an apprenticeship, and since I studied math, AND I have a good attitude, my application was accepted. __eou__ Congratulations! You do have the right attitude. __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening. Will you join us? __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business. __eou__
Well, if it isn't the teacher's pet! __eou__ Stop it. Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else. __eou__ You can't prove that by me. I saw the score on your report. __eou__ Hey, I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got. __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class. __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did. Admit it. __eou__ I worked hard too. But she always gives me a lower grade. __eou__ If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it. __eou__
You won one million yuan in a lottery. What will you say? __eou__ I don't know. I'm too excited to say a word. __eou__ I understand. It's too good to be true, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, too good to be true. __eou__
I was supposed to meet with you at half past one. __eou__ Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about? __eou__ There's a problem with my schedule. __eou__ What's the problem? __eou__ Two of my classes occur at the same time. __eou__ Well, I can see that's a problem. __eou__ Is it at all possible for you to fix that error? __eou__ Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes? __eou__ I want to keep both of them, if that's possible. __eou__ Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day. __eou__ Thanks a lot. __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday. __eou__ That sounds like fun. __eou__
Hello, Tom, are you free next Sunday? __eou__ I think so. Why did you ask that? __eou__ I'm going to have my first baby, so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday. __eou__ Congratulations! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born? __eou__ It's the tradition. But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri. __eou__ In any case, I like baby showers, because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world. __eou__ So you will come, won't you? __eou__ Of course. I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__
What are you doing? __eou__ What am I doing? What am I doing? Don't you know what day it is? __eou__ Mumm. no. __eou__ It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off. __eou__ What? __eou__ The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all. __eou__ I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl. __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals. __eou__ Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me. __eou__ Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It's a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they're really good! __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me! __eou__ Whatever dude, I'm going to go watch the opening match. __eou__
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime. __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous! __eou__
Where can I get the information, Kate? __eou__ Ask John. He is sure to know about it. __eou__ Why? __eou__ He has a finger in the pie. __eou__
That was a tough question. How did you get it right? __eou__ I just took a shot in the dark. __eou__
There's a letter here for you. __eou__ Let me see it. __eou__ What's the letter about? __eou__ It's a letter from NYU. __eou__ Tell me what it says! __eou__ I didn't get in. __eou__ You're lying. __eou__ I'm not lying. __eou__ Are you upset? __eou__ I had high hopes for NYU. __eou__ I'm sorry you didn't get accepted. __eou__ Hopefully, I'll get accepted to UCLA. __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month. Have you made good preparation? __eou__ Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year. __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year? __eou__ I am 100 % certain. __eou__ According to what you did last time, I have my doubts. __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time. __eou__
What? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets? __eou__ I'm sorry. I forget all about it. __eou__ How could you? I reminded you just this morning. __eou__ It's leap my mind. I really feel terrible about it. __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month. __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down. I'll make it up to you somehow. __eou__
Did you hear what happened to Mike last night? __eou__ No, what? __eou__ Well, apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble. Typical, isn't it? __eou__ Oh, no. What kind of trouble? __eou__ Well, I don't know the details, but... __eou__
Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business! __eou__ Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me. __eou__ What are you talking about? How does it exploit people? __eou__ Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies. __eou__ Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn't become addicted or anything like that. __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize! __eou__
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing! __eou__ Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black? You're wearing my pants right now! __eou__
I'm sure it will be wet when we arrive. __eou__ Yes. I dare say it will be. __eou__ It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed. __eou__ No. I don't think that's possible. Some places are sure to be open. __eou__ But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money. __eou__ Mmm, you may be right. __eou__ Do you think we'll need our overcoats? __eou__ No. We couldn't possibly. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ It will be summer. So it will be hot. __eou__ Is that very likely in England? __eou__ Yes. It could happen. __eou__
Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas. __eou__ What did you have in mind? __eou__ I don't know yet. __eou__ I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap. __eou__ I know what you mean. __eou__ I want to give a gift that is really meaningful. __eou__ Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them. __eou__ Or what only we are able to give them. __eou__
Uh... that's Greek to me. __eou__ That means they have tapered legs. __eou__ Well, mine are baggy. They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in. __eou__ Mine are, too. __eou__ So maybe we shouldn't go out after all. __eou__ Yeah. Let's just lounge around! __eou__
Thanks. Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something. Do you mind if I vent a little bit? __eou__ Of course not. If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out, you can just say whatever you want to me. __eou__ Great, because I am really mad at William. I mean, what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart, beautiful woman like me? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb. __eou__ Uh, A... you know I'm friends with William. __eou__ Oh right... present company excluded, of course! __eou__
Mary is really a diligent girl. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months. __eou__ She is really something. __eou__
Hello, this is David. __eou__ Hi David, this is Marge. Can you meet me after work for a few minutes? __eou__ Sure! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office? __eou__ That will work. __eou__ Does five thirty work for you? __eou__ That will be fine. What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time. __eou__ Is it the plans for my new house? __eou__ Yes. I just need to double check a few details with you. __eou__
I feel like going for a drink, it's been a long day. __eou__ Great idea! Peter, I could use the drink. __eou__ How about the new bar across road? __eou__ Sounds good. The food there is fantastic too. __eou__ I agree, I had lunch there last week. __eou__ Excellent! That sounds like a plan. __eou__
I have an idea for Christmas this year. __eou__ What is it? __eou__ Let's not exchange any gifts at all. __eou__ You big scrooge! __eou__ Hear me out. We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it! __eou__ But you may have some trouble convincing the kids. __eou__ Actual 1y, it was their idea first. __eou__ Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas. __eou__
Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes? __eou__ Yes. Are you in his class? __eou__ I'm thinking of taking his class next semester. __eou__ He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK? __eou__ Yes, I really need someone who is really good. __eou__ I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that? __eou__ Maybe, but I'm not sure. __eou__ Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you? __eou__ No, that stuff isn't important to me. __eou__ Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field? __eou__ I don't care about any of that. __eou__ We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped you. __eou__
Hey, Ben... did you catch the game last night? __eou__ Uh... what game? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points! __eou__ Um... and what sport are we talking about here? __eou__ Football of course! __eou__ Oh... football. Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals. __eou__ No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer. __eou__ Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there. __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball? __eou__ Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan? __eou__ Oh, certainly. I wouldn't miss a game for the world. My girlfriend says I have an addiction. And actually, if I had to choose between her and my games... I'd probably pick football. __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports. Is this just a part of your culture? __eou__ Oh, yeah! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young. Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together. __eou__
Julia, what's the weather forecast for tomorrow? __eou__ It says a storm may come tomorrow. __eou__ Oh! I hate rainy days! __eou__ Me, too. I'm always in low spirits when it rains. Are you going out tomorrow? __eou__ Yes. I have to drive to Washington D. C. __eou__ What bad luck! __eou__ Yeah! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct. Maybe tomorrow is a clear day. Who knows? __eou__ Yeah, maybe you are right! __eou__
Where would you like to have your dinner? __eou__ I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant. __eou__ You don't like Western food? __eou__ I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste. __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift. I'm looking forward to this party, but I didn't want to go alone. __eou__ Don't mention it. It's my pleasure. Have you been to one of these large, sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven? __eou__ No, this is my first. Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home. I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late. But I was the first one there. __eou__ I'll bet you were a little embarrassed. __eou__ You're right. The invitation said two to seven. I was there at two o'clock, but most people didn't arrive until three or four. They didn't start cooking until five o'clock. __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly. A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two. __eou__ Thanks for telling me this. __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall, but I'm hurrying. __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, and it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again. __eou__ Don't worry. We won't be the first. __eou__
That's really a let-down. __eou__ Yeah. He really does let me down. __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart. __eou__ I'm at the end of tether. I run out of ideas. __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets, so it's difficult to inform them. __eou__ Why not send them short messages? __eou__ Can short messages reach them? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center. Once they open the handsets they will receive them, which is better than you can't find them. __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot. If it's not too complicated I will send a short message, which can save much phone charge. __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call, and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year, didn't it? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages, from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations. __eou__
Hey, sorry to be late. __eou__ What happened to you last night? You didn't show up. __eou__ My mother was ill. I had to look after her. __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that. __eou__
Hi! How are you going? __eou__ Fine, thank you. How are you doing this morning? __eou__ Not bad. How about you? Haven't seen you for a long time. __eou__ Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday. __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself? __eou__ Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs? __eou__ Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day. __eou__ You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye. __eou__ Goodbye. __eou__
My goodness! What happened? You have blood on your face. __eou__ Oh, don't worry. I just killed a pigeon. __eou__ How could you have the heart to kill it? We only have one! __eou__ It spoiled my painting! __eou__
How annoying! __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program, the computer freezes. __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program. __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender. __eou__ That's open secret. __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job. __eou__ How did you know that? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me. Keep that to yourself. __eou__
Who did the stupid thing? __eou__ It must be Kate. __eou__ No, I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it. __eou__
Hello? __eou__ Hi Tina, It's Joe. __eou__ Hi Joe. __eou__ How's the weather there today? __eou__ It's really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early. __eou__ What's the temperature? __eou__ It's 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning. __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow. __eou__ I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer. __eou__ Me too. How's the weather where you are? __eou__ It's not too bad, but it's pretty cold here too. It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon. I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow. __eou__
Mike promised to help us. __eou__ Mike? How can you trust him to help us? __eou__ Why not? __eou__ He is too unpredictable. He says anything that pops into his head. And then he forgets it all. __eou__
Hello, Ann! Is that you? __eou__ Yes, it is. Hi, Tom! It's a real surprise to see you here. __eou__ It's been a long time! What's new? __eou__ Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well? __eou__ Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii. __eou__ How was it? __eou__ I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up. __eou__ Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour. __eou__ Ok, I won't keep you then. __eou__ Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye! __eou__ Yes, stay in touch. Bye! __eou__ Give me your email, would you? __eou__ Sure! It's txyb@gmail.com. __eou__
Tom, I've got good news for you. __eou__ What is it? __eou__ Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize? __eou__ Really? I can't believe it. It's like a dream come true. I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize! __eou__ You did a good job. I'm extremely proud of you. __eou__ Thanks for the compliment. __eou__ You certainly deserve it. Let's celebrate! __eou__
Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK? __eou__ I don't know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm feeling a little homesick. __eou__ Come on. We'Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. __eou__ I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family. __eou__ Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it. __eou__ I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out. __eou__ OK. how does this sound, let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there! __eou__ You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my wingman for tonight? __eou__ Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys'night out... well kinda... __eou__ Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it's not a pretty picture! __eou__
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday. __eou__ Which flight? __eou__ Flight 198. Fortunately, there were few passengers. __eou__ How about the passengers? __eou__ Well, all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally. __eou__
There are some things I miss. But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides, I grew up in Los Angeles, so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America? __eou__ I'm going to New York to visit my sister. She is in art school. I've never been to New York before. I'm kind of scared. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Well, I know a lot of people have guns there. I think maybe it isn't too safe. __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It's true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there, she must know the city pretty well already. __eou__ Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little. __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see? __eou__ I want to see the museums, and I want to shop a lot. __eou__ The museums are excellent. And the shopping! Well! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there. __eou__ Hmm. I hope not. __eou__
I'm thirsty. Pull over to that store, I'll buy some drinks. __eou__ I'm afraid I can't. Parking is not allowed here. __eou__ Oh, that's too bad, Where can you park around here? __eou__ There is a square in front of us. We can park the car there. __eou__ Is a shop there? __eou__ I'm not sure, you know I'm not familiar with the city, too. __eou__
Do you think I should ask Bob to help? Will he come? __eou__ No problem. You know him. He's the kind of guy that's always willing to go the extra miles. __eou__ That's right. But I have bothered him several times. __eou__ I bet he will come. __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? __eou__ Pardon? __eou__ What university would you enter? __eou__ University? Why? You asked me last year. __eou__ Oh, I forget.Sorry. __eou__ I went to Harvard University. __eou__ Did you? And what course did you take there? __eou__ God save me! Is there anything wrong with you?

What do you want for your birthday from your parents? __eou__ I don't know. Maybe a pair of new shoes. __eou__ Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC? You will soon use it at college. __eou__ That's a dandy idea. Thank you for reminding me. __eou__

Did you pass the test? __eou__ No, I didn't. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. __eou__
I'm really curious. What is it like doing housework all day for a living? __eou__ It's a little like being a mom, only I get paid for it! __eou__ I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing. Most women would rather hire a maid. __eou__ That's exactly why my business is doing so well! __eou__ How Ay clients do you have already? __eou__ Well, I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients. __eou__ Wow.

I've got a complaint about the noise next door. __eou__ Yes, it's most irritating. __eou__ Some people aren't very considerate. __eou__ We're going to do something about it. __eou__ Yes, I think so. __eou__ We can't put up with it any more. __eou__ We'll play the CD loud, is that all right? __eou__ I don't think so. __eou__ What should we do? __eou__ Why don't we call them? __eou__ Good idea. __eou__
Jim, I heard you'Ve bought a new computer. __eou__ Yes. Look, it is on my desk. __eou__ Your office looks different with a computer. By the way, is it difficult to use a computer? __eou__ Not at all.

I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus. __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus, but I could rarely throw it in the right direction! I was awful.

I liked the sprints best. __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters. I usually did well in the dong jump competitions, but I couldn't compete with kids from other schools in the javelin. How about you? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships, but I never won. Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events? __eou__ Yes, I did, but I didn't do very well. I made the final in both events, but came last. At least I made the final. I was very pleased with that. __eou__
May I have an appointment with you tonight? __eou__ Very sorry, I am occupied tonight. What about tomorrow night? __eou__ OK. where and when? __eou__ 7:00 in my staying hotel. __eou__ OK, I am going to the hotel to pick you up. See you tomorrow night. __eou__
Do you think people still have faith in the government? __eou__ I don't think so. __eou__ Why is that? __eou__ The government will never fulfill their promise. __eou__ So it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it. __eou__
How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read? __eou__ How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read? __eou__ He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school. __eou__ Does he even know how to speak English? __eou__ No. But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there. __eou__ That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me. __eou__ Come on.

How are things with you? __eou__ Not bad. You know I'm an air traffic controller now. __eou__ Now that's an exciting job!!! __eou__ Yes, but it's very stressful. __eou__
Tom and Helen got married at last. __eou__ How did you know that? I heart Tom's father didn't agree with that. __eou__ I was invited to attend their wedding. __eou__ It's great. Although his father didn't agree with that, Tom went through with it. __eou__ How moving love is. __eou__

Give me a call tomorrow. __eou__ Okay. __eou__
I really need a new pair of trousers. __eou__ Do you? __eou__ Yes, I do. This one is very old now. __eou__ They look all right to me. __eou__ They're not all right. They're uncomfortable and they look terrible. __eou__ All right. All right. __eou__

what did you do over the weekend? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London. It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment. __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening. __eou__ like what? __eou__ well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start. __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment? __eou__ if you do have to drive, you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, your home should use sources of renewable energy. __eou__ how about recycling? Does that actually help? __eou__ yes. You should take your glass, paper, plastic, cardboard, and tin cans to a recycling center. __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone. __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before! __eou__ to be honest, in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment. __eou__

Hey Mark. What are you doing? __eou__ Just watching some TV. __eou__ Anything interesting on? __eou__ Not really. Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN. __eou__ So I take it you're pretty bored too. __eou__ Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you going to do? __eou__ It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us? __eou__ You wanna shoot some hoops? __eou__ I already tried to call up some of the guys, but they are all busy. __eou__ Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today. __eou__ She's out shopping with her friends. __eou__ Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then. __eou__ Aright. Do you have any cigarettes? __eou__ I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way. __eou__ Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes. __eou__ Aright. See you there. __eou__

hey, Tom, did you enjoy your lunch? __eou__ oh, don't mention it. It was terrible. __eou__ what'the matter? __eou__ the food station was as crowded as usual. I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone. __eou__ I see. You simply can't blame the server for this. __eou__ yes, I know. Fast food is so popular in this district. __eou__ that's true. __eou__ anyway, how was your such, Catherine? __eou__ it was good. I brough lunch from home today. __eou__ you did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America. __eou__ well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy. __eou__ i guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat. __eou__ yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, don't you? __eou__ you bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America. __eou__ well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places. __eou__ seriously? __eou__ yeah, it's hard to believe but true. __eou__
What's your favorite TV Program? __eou__ I like variety shows. __eou__ I also like variety shows, but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor. __eou__ I prefer a variety show without a host. __eou__
What's up? You look low. __eou__ It's my girlfriend. I guess she's playing the army game. __eou__ How come? __eou__ I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again. __eou__ I understand that. But I think maybe it's not a date. You are taking the matter too much to heart. __eou__ Maybe. But it still gets on my nerves. __eou__
Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday? __eou__ Yes, I did. I heard that they took both drivers to hospital. One needed surgery. __eou__ Yes. I heard he had a few broken bones too, but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems. __eou__ The second driver was luckier. He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound. __eou__ Yes. He was released from hospital yesterday evening. The other man could be there for weeks. __eou__ I understand that he's connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus. His condition can't be very good. __eou__ The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable. What does that mean? __eou__ It means he's really badly injured, but he will almost certainly survive. __eou__ His family will be pleased to hear that. They must have been so worried. __eou__
Happy New Year, Bill. __eou__ Happy New Year, Steven. __eou__ Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday? __eou__ My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting. What about you? __eou__ How happy you are! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam. __eou__
Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you? If she does, she will certainly bend over backwards for you. But if she doesn't, it would be a job to change her. __eou__ I don't know whether she has it bad for me, but she enjoys being with me. __eou__ And do you really love her? __eou__ I think I do. I don't think I can be happier with another girl. __eou__
A friend of mine is now in the big house. He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine. __eou__ That is a deadly risky business. He should have it coming on him. __eou__ He must be regretting about having done the business. __eou__ I bet he is. He domed his own life. __eou__
I met Mark yesterday. He looked blue. __eou__ He's been on the gravy train these years, hasn't he? __eou__ It belongs to the past. He lost his job the other day, and he's up a tree now. __eou__ It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time. __eou__
Look, the aliens are sending a message to Mulder. This rocks! __eou__ Whoops. That's my pager. I had to get it for work. __eou__ You have a pager?! That's a little high-tech for you, Stu. Are you sure you know how to use it? __eou__ Well, I know how to turn it off! __eou__ No, you don't! It's still beeping! Come on, hand it over and I'll turn it off for you. __eou__
I want to meet you. Are you free this evening? __eou__ Well, actually, I'm not free today. Do you have anything urgent? __eou__ No, I just want to meet you. __eou__ How about tomorrow instead. __eou__ Hmm, that's all right. Shall we meet at the bar near the beach? __eou__ All right. See you then. __eou__
Do you have any tissue, Eve? I've used all mine. __eou__ Here. Are you all right? __eou__ Thanks. I am all right. It's just my nose. It must be an allergy. Do you have any aspirin? I have a terrible headache. __eou__ I don't have an aspirin. Perhaps you should go to a doctor. __eou__ No, no. I am okay. It's the weather. It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining. __eou__ Really, John. I still think you should go to a doctor. You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning. Why don't you take this afternoon off? If you don't want to see a doctor, at least you can go home and have a good rest. __eou__ I can't. I am already behind the schedule. Besides, you know Mr. White. He would think that I was putting him on. __eou__ You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning, and you can't do anything this afternoon like this. Gee! You've got a fever. __eou__ Do I? Oh, no. __eou__ Listen to me. You go home now. I will call my doctor and have him go over. Ok? __eou__ What about Mr.White? __eou__ I'll handle him. Now go home. I'll call you after work. __eou__ Thanks a lot, Eve. Goodbye. __eou__
How about a movie on Sunday, Mum? __eou__ Well, I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films. __eou__ We could find a classical one. __eou__ That sounds fine. __eou__
You are in love with Mary, right? __eou__ You are pulling my legs! __eou__ I am not blind. Anyone can see that with half an eye. __eou__
I'm going on a cruise this summer. __eou__ No kidding? __eou__ My brother won a free trip and he's taking me. __eou__ You can't beat that. __eou__
Where do you spend the weekend? __eou__ We've a country house. __eou__ That's nice. __eou__ Join us, will you? __eou__ That'd be great! Thank you. __eou__
How's your work? __eou__ Good, thanks. How about you? __eou__ Not bad. But we have lost a few of staff lately. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Because of the low salaries. __eou__ But your company is huge. Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages? __eou__ I don't know why. __eou__ Why don't you give them a suggestion? __eou__ May be I can have a try. But I'm on vacation now. __eou__
Good morning, Linda. How have you been? __eou__ Pretty bad. I'Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can't get rid of it. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can do? __eou__ No, thanks. __eou__ Well, I hope you'll feel better soon. __eou__ Thank you for your concern. __eou__
Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend? __eou__ I'm not really into racecar driving. __eou__ You were when we were in high school. That, and baseball. __eou__ Yeah, well, times change. Look at you-you're a father now. You can't say that you haven't changed. __eou__ True, but I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now. __eou__ I mean, I know spring training's over, but I'm just not into all that. __eou__ Hello? Is the real Taylor in there? __eou__
How do you feel? __eou__ I'm nervous as can be. __eou__
I can't believe it! I lost. __eou__ It looks like you have to buy tickets for us, Jason. And we're not going to see an action movie! __eou__ That's not fair, you got all the easy questions. __eou__ I guess that's just the luck of the draw. __eou__ I want a rematch. Let's play again. __eou__ Sorry, not tonight! __eou__
do you need a hand? __eou__ no, I can handle it. Thanks anyway. __eou__ are you sure you don't need any help? __eou__ well, maybe just a little. I can't seem to make it fit. __eou__ I swear, the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller! __eou__ that's so true. thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row? __eou__ yes. What about you? __eou__ I'm in the middle seat. __eou__ oh, I guess I'll let you through then. __eou__ thanks. sorry for making you get out of your seat again. __eou__ that's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one? __eou__ no, not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian? __eou__ I prefer the British paper, but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away. __eou__ I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, so the Guardian is all yours. __eou__ thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum? __eou__ that would be great. thanks. __eou__
Are you listening to me, Dan? __eou__ I'm with you, Jane. __eou__ What did I just say? __eou__ Well, uh... I didn't catch the last part. __eou__ Just what I thought! __eou__
Man, I'm freaking out! You gotta help me! __eou__ Whoa, whoa, take it easy, relax. Geez, you're sweating like a pig! What's going on? __eou__ I can't go through with this! I just can't! I'm not ready for marriage! What was I thinking? I'm only thirty five years old! I'Ve got my entire life ahead of me, adventures waiting! I can't settle down yet! __eou__ What are you talking about? It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family! __eou__ I know. I know! __eou__ Let's think this through. First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar. Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, you are just getting cold feet. You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, so cut the crap and do it! __eou__ You're right. I'm being crazy! Ok, I'm ready, let's do this! __eou__ Great! Phew! That was a close one! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you. __eou__
Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. __eou__ How come? __eou__ It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't. __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy? __eou__ Yeah. It's so nice of you to comfort me. __eou__
Who's that over here? __eou__ That's the new teacher. __eou__ What do you think of the teacher? __eou__ She's very nice. __eou__ What does she teach? __eou__ English, of course. __eou__ Is she your teacher? __eou__ Yes. She teaches our class three times a week. __eou__ Can she speak Chinese to her students? __eou__ Not very much. __eou__ It's a good thing you can speak English! __eou__
The teacher just canceled the test. __eou__ Are you kidding? __eou__
Hello? __eou__ Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing? __eou__ Oh, hi. I was just watching TV. __eou__ There's nothing to watch right now. __eou__ I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored. __eou__ Me too. Let's get together and do something. __eou__ I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow? __eou__ Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow. __eou__ Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow? __eou__ I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny. __eou__ That's great. We can do something outdoors then. __eou__ Are there any special events going on tomorrow? __eou__ Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow. __eou__ Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out. __eou__ Do you know what time it starts? __eou__ It starts at one PM. __eou__ Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, we can head over there. __eou__ Perfect. I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty. __eou__
Would you go to the bookstore with me? __eou__ It sounds a good idea. Let's go. __eou__ Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel? __eou__ Yes. I heard about that. And I know you want to buy it, but I'm not interested in detective novels. __eou__ So what are you interested in? __eou__ Magazines about fashions, such as Cosmo Polian. __eou__ I know that magazine. It's very popular. __eou__ Yes. I can lend you some. __eou__ Thank you. But I'm not interested. __eou__
When can we expect you for dinner? Can you come tonight? __eou__ Not tonight. I promised to go to a concert with my sister. __eou__ Well... How about Friday then? __eou__ That sounds fine. __eou__ Good. Shall we say seven o'clock? __eou__ I'll be there. You're still a fabulous cook, aren't you? __eou__ That'll be for you to decide. I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you. __eou__ I'm ready. I'll look forward to it all Friday! __eou__
I don't understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you'Ve got good news everyday. __eou__ Really? Do I look happy all the time? __eou__ All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers. __eou__ Oh, do you know why? Actually, it's easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive! __eou__ Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you. __eou__ Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring. __eou__ It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week. __eou__ But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don't students want to have a good memory? __eou__ Of course. I didn't know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions? __eou__ Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first. __eou__ Oh, I know. Thank you. __eou__
Which kind of sport do you like to watch? __eou__ Basketball, football, table tennis. I will watch them on TV. __eou__ So you must like NBA game. __eou__ Yeah, it is my favorite. Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game. I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian, the Chinese players in NBA. __eou__ What kind of sport do you like to participate in? __eou__ I am good at tennis and skiing. What about you? __eou__ I prefer the indoor sports, such as bowling, badminton and squash. __eou__ Moderate exercise is really important for health.'Life lies in movement.'__eou__ How about playing tennis with me? __eou__ Good idea. I will take the racket. __eou__
Good morning, Jerry.How's everything? __eou__ Fine, just fine.Thanks. __eou__ Doing anything for lunch? __eou__ Well, as a matter of fact, I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas. __eou__
Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get started using these machines? __eou__ Of course. Are you a new member here? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Welcome. My name is Johnson. __eou__ Nice to meet you. __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights? __eou__ No, I don't. So I need some help. __eou__ Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines. __eou__ Yes, I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines. __eou__ Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you. __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one. __eou__ No. Not that. I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here, let me show you. __eou__ I'm ready. __eou__ Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine. __eou__ I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress. __eou__ Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you. __eou__ Alright. Great. __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here. __eou__ Great. Why don't we start on the machines? __eou__ Are you alright? Can you do more? __eou__ I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted. __eou__ That's okay. Don't worry.It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning. __eou__ What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines. __eou__ We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right? __eou__ Yes. I suppose it's best to stop. __eou__
Don't be afraid. Give it a try. __eou__ Okay. __eou__
what are you doing? __eou__ I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle. Whenever I get the time, I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper. __eou__ you really like brains that make you think, don't you? __eou__ I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at! __eou__ Doesn't everyone? Which games are those? __eou__ Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours. __eou__ Did you play a lot of games when you were little? __eou__ My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend. __eou__ Do you still like playing those games? __eou__ Not at all. I never really did, to be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together? __eou__ Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games. __eou__ Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that? __eou__ No, I prefer to play with people I know. __eou__ How about mah-jong? __eou__ It's a popular game with some people, but I've never played it. __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you, but unlike what most people think, we aren't all exactly the same! __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful. __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job. When he finds one, everything will be settled. __eou__ I hope so. __eou__
They got a divorce at last. __eou__ It's inevitable. Their love wasbuilt on the sand, and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks. __eou__ You said it. Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks. __eou__ That give us a good lesson. __eou__
Do you like traveling, Kathy? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance. But I don't like traveling to work, waiting for buses, or... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you're driving. __eou__ Exactly. __eou__
Can you believe that Susan got married? __eou__ Really? I remember she said if she would remain single. Is the man very rich? __eou__ No. That's what is surprising me. __eou__ You means she didn't marry a rich man. __eou__ He's a postman. __eou__ I thought she would marry a fortune. __eou__
What sort of things do you grow in your garden? __eou__ I grow a variety of things, so that something is in bloom all year round. __eou__ When is your garden at its best? __eou__ It looks best in spring, when the plum and cherry blossoms are out. __eou__
Good afternoon! __eou__ Good afternoon! Sit down, please.How are you? __eou__ I'm very well, thank you.How are you? __eou__ Very well too, thank you very much.Isn't it a lovely day? __eou__ Yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ What's the weather like in your country? __eou__ Mm... It's quite warm now. __eou__ Where do you live? __eou__ In London.Where do you live? __eou__ Here.Near this school. __eou__
Oh, no! Now I'll be late. __eou__ Can I give you a hand? __eou__ Yes, I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown. __eou__ Sure thing. I've got time. __eou__
What a great weekend that was! __eou__ My feelings exactly. __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer. __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more. __eou__ We should come here more often. __eou__ You are absolutely right. __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend. __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel. __eou__
What's this, I wonder? __eou__ I'm not sure.Let me have a look... It could be a coffee grinder. __eou__ A coffee grinder? __eou__ Yes, it must be used for grinding coffee beans. __eou__ Oh, that would be very useful. __eou__
We've got a new manager in our department. __eou__ Oh? You hoped to get that job, didn't you? __eou__ Yes, I did. __eou__ I'm sorry. That's too bad. Who is it? Who got the job, I mean? __eou__ Someone called Drexler. Carl Drexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job, too __eou__ Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex, of course! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman? __eou__ Yes, that was probably it! It isn't fair. __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear? __eou__ A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it. __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater? __eou__ It's possible, isn't it? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes? __eou__ Well... perhaps you should think about it. __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress? __eou__ I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all! __eou__ Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing! __eou__ Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. But it isn't. Not in this company. __eou__
It's a sunny day, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, it is. I'm Jennifer. Nice to meet you. __eou__ My name is David. Nice to meet you, too. __eou__ Are you American? __eou__ No, I'm a Britisher. Where do you come from? __eou__ I come from America. Are you a freshman? __eou__ Yes. What about you? __eou__ Me, too. __eou__ Great. Maybe we can study and play games together. I think we can be good friends. __eou__ Yeah. Anytime. __eou__
You keep bowling spares but no strike. __eou__ I don't know why, but I think there's something wrong with my hands. I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball. __eou__ I don't think it was the problem with your hands, you did several excellent spares. You have no problem with your hands. __eou__ Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball? __eou__ The problem is you are too nervous. You want to have a strike so much, so you deliver the ball too hard. And when it comes to the I second roll, there's no pressure. That's why you could bowl all those spares. __eou__ Really? I will try again. __eou__
Nice to see you, Patrick. __eou__ Bob! I hear your team won the match. __eou__ Yeah. All of us tried our best. __eou__ Congratulations! __eou__ Thanks. __eou__
Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon? __eou__ No I'm afraid not. I'm meeting Ruth then. How about the fourteenth in the morning? __eou__ I'm sorry. I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then. __eou__ What about the next day? __eou__ No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon? __eou__ Yes, I think I am. Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant. __eou__ Good idea! Is two o'clock okay? __eou__ That's fine. See you there! __eou__
Did you enjoy the movie? __eou__ Oh, it's really a drag. __eou__ Sorry to hear that. I think it's even better than On the Golden pond. __eou__ Hell with it! Nobody will give it an Academy award! __eou__
Hi Jackie. You don't look too well. What's going on? __eou__ It's nothing. I'm just a little stressed out. __eou__ Why? What's stressing you out? __eou__ School. Since I was working part time, I had a difficult time keeping up with class. Now that we have exams coming up, I'm totally freaking out. __eou__ The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright. __eou__ I hope so. I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days. That's what it'll take. __eou__ I have to study for an exam too. Why don't we study together. We can encourage each other. __eou__ That will be great. __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before. I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format. __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page? I thought the old page wasn't half bad... __eou__ The old page was okay, alright, but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume, because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect. Now it's different. We got our marketing department team in on the action, and the results are smashing... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page? __eou__ First, the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information. They can sign up for a free monthly drawing. Once we've got their info, it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting. Also, there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services, so as to give confidence to new customers. We also added a specific area for on-line customer service... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback... __eou__ Great! __eou__
Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better? __eou__ Are you sure? How do you know? __eou__ Well, usually people think I'm a terrible singer, but after we all have a few beers, they say I sound a lot better! __eou__ Well, I heard that if you drink enough beer, you can speak foreign languages better... __eou__
Pardon me. Could you please pass me the tissue? __eou__ Sure, here you are. __eou__ Thanks, I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy. Are you ok? __eou__ Yeah, I think the food is alright, it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, you should have known better. __eou__ Well, not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies. __eou__ Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy. __eou__ Yeah, you can increase you tolerance for spicy food, but so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes. __eou__ I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, but when you have no other choices, you've got to adapt. __eou__ Yeah, I guess that's a typical example of'when in Rome, do as the Romans do.'__eou__ Exactly. __eou__
Tom, Christmas Day is coming. Merry Christmas to you. __eou__ Thank you. And a merry Christmas to you! __eou__
Could you lend your bike to me for several days? __eou__ How long would you like to keep it? __eou__ Till the end of the week. __eou__ Yes, that'd be all right. __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted? __eou__ Yes, at first I felt very awkward. After Bill was demoted and then resigned, it was kind of like somebody died! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something. And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to... __eou__ Did they mutiny? __eou__ Thankful, no. I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career. I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor. After a couple weeks, it was like nothing happened. __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them. __eou__ Yeah, and they also take the blame, that's what happened to my old boss... __eou__
How about a game of tennis? __eou__ Okay. Loser has to take out the trash for a month. __eou__ It's a deal. __eou__ See you in the court. __eou__
Are you feeling better today, Bill? __eou__ Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. __eou__ You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. __eou__ You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit. __eou__ But you should make up your mind first. __eou__ You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake. __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work. __eou__ Thank you for your advice! I'll try it. __eou__
Hi, John, how was your vacation? __eou__ Awesome, we went to Australia and New Zealand. __eou__ That must have been wonderful. Do anything interesting? __eou__ Well, we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia. __eou__ Wow! Isn't that dangerous? __eou__ A little, but the rush was worth it. __eou__ Tell me about it. __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us. __eou__ 500 feet! I would never be able to do that. __eou__ Yeah, It was scary, but exhilarating. __eou__
What did her boss say to you? __eou__ He asked me to beef up in the work. __eou__ Yeah. You look so unhappy recently. What's the matter. __eou__ Nothing, thanks. I am just not in the mood these days. __eou__
Hi, Tina, it's Joe. __eou__ Hi, Joe. __eou__ What's the weather like there today? __eou__ It's really cold. It snowed all day and the school closed early. __eou__ What's the temperature? __eou__ It's 20 degrees below zero now. It was even colder this morning. __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow. __eou__ I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer. __eou__ Me too. How's the weather where you are? __eou__ It's not too bad, but it's pretty cold here too. I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow. __eou__
Mom, I just finished my paper. Can you proofread it before I hand it in? __eou__ Sure, let's take a look. Sweetie, this is terrific. Your ideas are so original. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__ I can tell you worked hard on it. __eou__ I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago. __eou__ Well, it was definitely worth all the time. __eou__ Let's just hope my teacher agrees. __eou__
How about doing shopping this weekend? __eou__ What're you going to buy? __eou__ Sportshoes.Will you go with me? __eou__ OK. __eou__
Merry Christmas! __eou__ Huh? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here? __eou__ It is? Oh, that's nice. __eou__ Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited? __eou__ Actually, I'd forgotten about it. __eou__ Forgotten about it? How could you? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish. __eou__ Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. __eou__ It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian. __eou__ I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year? __eou__ Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break. __eou__ Well, would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house? __eou__ Not at all. A party is a party. I'll be happy to come. __eou__
It's all over. I'm bankrupt. __eou__ Don't worry. Everything will be fine. __eou__
Bill, Happy Halloween! __eou__ Happy Halloween! What creature are you going to dress up as? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs. __eou__ May I have a look at your costume? __eou__ Sure. Wait a moment. ( Several minutes later ) Here you are. __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool. __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight. Maybe I will suck their blood. __eou__ Haha. Wish you good luck. __eou__
I think that's settled. __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions. Who do you think you are! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this. __eou__ Why not? __eou__
Hey, Karen. Look like you got some sun this weekend. __eou__ Yeah? I guess so. I spent the weekend at beach. __eou__ That's great. Where did you stay? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there, and they invited me there. __eou__ So, what did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, obviously. __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down. __eou__ Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming? __eou__ I wanted to, but the water is too cold, and I just wetted in up to my knees. __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that. __eou__ It looks like you could use it. Don't tell me you spent the weekend in the library again. __eou__
OK class, so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class, today we will review everything we have learned. Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is? __eou__ The brain! __eou__ That's right, the brain! It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition. Then what major organ is in our chest? __eou__ The heart! __eou__ Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food? __eou__ The stomach and intestines! __eou__ Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything? __eou__ Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder! __eou__ Oh yes, you are right. Very important organs indeed. __eou__ So what do these organs do, teacher? __eou__ Well, mumm, they... Time for a break! We can talk about it when you get back. __eou__
It's not good for business recently. __eou__ Not good for business? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities. __eou__ Too risky anyway.It's necessary to look before you leap. __eou__
Do you know how to play go? __eou__ It's easy. All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory. __eou__ But I heard it is very difficult to play. __eou__ It's easier said than done. When you actually play, it can be very frustrating. __eou__
Linda? Is that you? I haven't seen you in ages! __eou__ Hi George! It's good to see you! __eou__ What have you been up to? __eou__ I just opened up my own business not long ago. __eou__ Good for you! What are you doing? __eou__ I'm a professional party planner here in the city. I do catering and all that. __eou__ I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun! __eou__ Well, I don't know about the profit part yet. But I am really having fun! __eou__
So, what's new in the kitchen? That refrigerator is new, isn't it? __eou__ Yes. I needed a large one. Before, I had a separate refrigerator and freezer, but this has both combined into one. __eou__ That's usual nowadays. You'Ve added a few shelves too. __eou__ Yes. You know I'Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients. __eou__ Did you buy new cupboards too? __eou__ No, I didn't. I gave them a really good clean, so they just look new. The worktop was in poor condition, so I had a new one added. __eou__ I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils. __eou__ Yes, I have. I need them to help me with these new dished I'm trying to make. I need a little more practice before I invite guests over. __eou__ Looking at the spice rack, I'd say you'Ve been learning how to make asian food. __eou__ Yes. I'Ve always likes Indian and thai food, so I'Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I'm pretty good at making curries now, but I still need practice at making thai food. __eou__ Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays, it's very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket. __eou__ I hope you can stay for dinner. I need a guinea pig! __eou__
How do you like skiing, Pat? __eou__ I love it. All my life I wanted to learn to ski. Finally I took lessons last year. __eou__ I suppose skiing is easy for you. __eou__ No, quite the opposite. I thought I'd never stop falling down. Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better. __eou__ I see. Do you ski often? __eou__ Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night. __eou__ That sounds great. __eou__ Oh, yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski? __eou__ Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg __eou__ Don't be so frightened. It's just a skill. __eou__
Hi, Dave. This is Zina. __eou__ Zina? Zina the Snake? __eou__ I got your e-mail a couple of months back. __eou__ Yeah? Which one was that? __eou__ The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep. __eou__ Right. That one. Did it work? __eou__
Hello, my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight. __eou__ Yes, what can I do for you? __eou__ I need to cancel that. We have had a last minute change of plans. __eou__ I see. Would you like me to reschedule you for another night? __eou__ OK, we will let you know as early as possible. By the way, will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation? __eou__ Certainly. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__ That's all right. I hope we can help you at some other time. Good-bye. __eou__ Good-bye. __eou__
Can I use your laptop for a while? __eou__ Sure, go ahead. __eou__ Oh, isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable? __eou__ Yes, it is. You want go online? there are no wi-fi hotspots around. __eou__ Oh my, no internet access is killing me. __eou__ Can't you wait till you get home? then you can surf the internet using the broadband, wireless connection or whatever you like. __eou__ No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends. __eou__ Now I see, you must be suffering from discomgoogolation. __eou__ What does that mean? there's nothing wrong with me. __eou__ Well, the term'discomgoogolation'comes from'discombobulate'and'google'. Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, net users are very likely to become addicted to the web. __eou__ That's alright. I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information. It almost drives me crazy. __eou__ Then, you're probably addicted. __eou__
Sally, I'm tired of this Western food. I really miss my mother's Sichuan cooking. __eou__ I'm sure you do miss that type of cooking. But can't you try to get used to Western food? __eou__ I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much. __eou__ I suppose you're right, Lee. Maybe that's why so many Westerners are overweight. __eou__ It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy. __eou__ You see, because we are often busy working, we eat too much fast food, and that food is very fattening. __eou__
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day. __eou__ Ok, on that day, boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return. __eou__ So romantic. Young people must have lot of fun. __eou__ Yeah, that is the holiday is hot, isn't it? __eou__
What will happen to the children if you break up? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children. __eou__ Why don't you make up with John. __eou__ It's too late. __eou__
Have you ever been to Japan? I'm going in the fall. __eou__ Yeah, I've been there twice. __eou__ Really? Tell me about it. What's it like? __eou__ Oh, it's fantastic. __eou__ Where did you go? __eou__ On my first trip I went to Tokyo, and on my second trip I visited Kyoto. __eou__ What did you think of Tokyo? __eou__ Very big and exciting, but very crowded, too. __eou__ Yeah. I've seen pictures of the crowds! __eou__ And the restaurant are excellent... but they're kind of expensive. __eou__ And how about Kyoto? __eou__ Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It's a very historic city. __eou__ How was the weather? __eou__ I was in Tokyo in August, and it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny, but there was no humidity. __eou__ Sounds perfect. I can't wait! __eou__
Where do you live now? __eou__ I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities. __eou__ Which street do you live on? __eou__ I live at No. 50 Xingu Street. __eou__
Who did the stupid thing? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick. __eou__ I don't think so. Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that. __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it. __eou__
Can I help you? __eou__ Yes. I'd like to borrow these books. __eou__ Just a second. I'll see if I can find them for you. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__ Here you are. You must return them within a month. __eou__ What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month? __eou__ You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them. __eou__ OK.Thank you very much for your trouble. __eou__ No trouble at all. So long. __eou__
Hi Sam, would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday? __eou__ Sure, I love curry. Who else is coming? __eou__ Jane, Susan, Pete and two colleagues of mine from work. __eou__ I have no plans for Friday, so curry would be great. Which restaurant do you have in mind? __eou__ Susan suggested the one on Main Street. She says it is very good. __eou__ Which one is that? __eou__ You know, the one just on the corner with Oxford Street. There is a large pharmacy next door. __eou__ Oh yes, I know which one you mean. I have never been there, but I looked at their menu once and it did look good. __eou__ Okay then. I think we will all meet outside? __eou__ What time? __eou__ At 8 o'clock. I will make the reservation. __eou__ That's good. See you on Friday. __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school? __eou__ No, I was way too busy studying all the time. How about you? __eou__ Yeah, I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant. __eou__ What was that like? __eou__ It was always very busy there. __eou__ What did you do? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders. __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job? __eou__ Yeah, I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free. __eou__
Did you like the play? __eou__ Not really. It's a dull one, and the production isn't satisfactory, either. __eou__ You're absolutely right. The acting could be better. __eou__ To be fair, though, both the costumes and scenery are marvelous. __eou__
I need some books on hardware. __eou__ There's many books here.What about these? __eou__ Great! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books? __eou__ Sure.But you can only keep them for a week. __eou__ I see.Thank you. __eou__
I don't know why I married him. __eou__ What is the matter? __eou__ He never see eye to eye with me. __eou__ That is to say, love is blind. __eou__
Why is the long face? __eou__ I'm getting sick of work man. I can't take the political bull in the company any more. __eou__ Did you just get your review or something? __eou__ Yeah, but that's not why I am upset. I just found out another guy got a promotion. He doesn't know how to do anything. He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long. __eou__ That sucks. __eou__ I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies. __eou__ Look on the bright side. At least you have a job. __eou__ Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it. __eou__ Exactly. Instead, we should have some drinks tonight. __eou__ How about a cold bottle of beer. __eou__ Now you're talking. __eou__
You're so witty... __eou__ So why is the face tilted to the right? __eou__ This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand. __eou__ So it's not as convenient for left-handed people? __eou__ It's better for right-handed people like me. See, I don't even have to move my arm to see the time. __eou__ I'm left-handed. You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it... __eou__ Bingo! __eou__
Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert? __eou__ I am sorry, sir.All the tickets have been sold out. __eou__ What a shame. Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening? __eou__ Sorry, sir. The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st. __eou__ That's fine. I want 2 tickets. __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot? __eou__ Yes, he does. He of ten has had one to many. But I advised him not to drink too much, he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table. __eou__ That's a problem. He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything. __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management? __eou__ Yes, we do. __eou__ How many nights a week is it? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. __eou__ And how long does the course last? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months. __eou__ When does it start? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th. __eou__ What time is the class? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock. __eou__ How much does it cost? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month. __eou__ Yes, that's all right. I want to enroll in the course. __eou__ Thank you, please fill out this form for us. __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now? __eou__ Yes, please. We need a record of you education and your work experiences. __eou__
How many passengers are there aboard the ship? __eou__ Seventy-six, I think. __eou__
What's your schedule like this year? __eou__ Pretty busy. I have to pick up a lot of credits this year. __eou__ What's your major? __eou__ I'm majoring in French literature. __eou__ Oh, don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long. __eou__ That's right. We got the assignment last week. __eou__ When is it due? __eou__ Next Monday! __eou__ Remind me never to sign up for that course! __eou__
Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say? __eou__ Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery? __eou__ Let's see... If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world. __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that! __eou__ Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married? __eou__ If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed! __eou__
Something wrong? __eou__ Yes. My car is having problems. __eou__ What's wrong? __eou__ It won't start. __eou__ Do you want me to take a look? __eou__ No, thank you. I think I can handle it. __eou__ Well, if you change your mind, let me know. __eou__ I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you. __eou__ No problem. __eou__ I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some? __eou__ Sure. I have all kinds of tools. Just ask. I'll be happy to get them for you. __eou__ Thanks. That would be very helpful. __eou__ Anything for you. Seriously, I don't mind helping. __eou__ OK. If you really insist, I could always use the company. __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven. Where on earth have you been? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late. I just couldn't help it. __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry. __eou__ Look, just give me a chance. I can explain it. __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree? __eou__ I suppose I do. __eou__ The climate here is pleasant. __eou__ They use said it __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living. __eou__ It sure is __eou__ No other city can match it. It's heaven. __eou__ Well, if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much. __eou__ Maybe. __eou__ That's for sure. __eou__
Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated? __eou__ Yeah, I know. __eou__ I didn't know it until yesterday. I put my foot into it, and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married. __eou__
Alice, your father is amazing. He's 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. __eou__ I know. He doesn't like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent. __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own. __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength. __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent. __eou__
How are you making out? __eou__ I'm doing fine.Don't mind me.It's a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself. __eou__ I hope so. Thank you again for your delightful gift. __eou__ Don't mention it. __eou__
Happy Birthday, Mary! __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it. __eou__ What a lovely dog! How did you know I love this? __eou__ I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt. __eou__ Maybe you don't believe it, but it was made by my grandmother. __eou__ Really? It looks so nice. __eou__ Thank you. Please have a cup of tea. __eou__ All right. __eou__ How about some fish? __eou__ No, thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, before you blow out the birthday candles, you have to make a wish. After that, you may cut the cake. __eou__ OK, let me make a wish... Do you want a big piece of cake? __eou__ No, just a small one. Next let's sing'Happy Birthday'to Mary. __eou__ It is very kind of you. I'm so moved by you. __eou__
How did you meet your girlfriend? __eou__ I met Amanda through a friend. __eou__ That's great. Did you start dating right after you met, or did you become friends first? __eou__ We started dating right away. __eou__
Is there anything available for tonight? __eou__ There are some seats in the rear mezzanine. __eou__ Isn't there anything else available? __eou__ No, the show is almost sold out. __eou__
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years. How is he doing? __eou__ He's not doing too well. __eou__ Why? What's wrong? __eou__ About a year ago, he started feeling weak all the time. __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick. __eou__ Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth. __eou__ That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life. __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday. __eou__ Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me. __eou__ Thanks. I'll let him know. __eou__
Wedding rings! __eou__ Oh, no... __eou__ Aren't they cool? I like the settings. __eou__ Jen, is there someone you're not telling me about? __eou__ No. I just like looking at wedding rings, OK? __eou__ Women are such dreamers. __eou__ These are specially designed for the year 2000! __eou__
Hurry up, get in. __eou__ I'm in, let's go! __eou__ OK, make a left here... no wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up! __eou__ Geez! What's the rush? __eou__ Don't worry about it, just drive. Oh, no, the light is about to change... step on it! __eou__ Are you nuts! I'm not going to run a red light! __eou__ Whatever. Just turn right here.... The freeway will be packed at this hour.... let's take a side street.Go on! Get out of our way! Move, move! __eou__ What's your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help! __eou__ Here, I know a short cut... just go down here, and we'll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let's go, let's go! Watch out for that lady! __eou__ I'm going as fast as I can! __eou__ Yes! We made it. 5:58, just before the library closes. __eou__ You're such a geek! __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan. Is it a beautiful country? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful, but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France, don't you? __eou__ Yes, I do feel the same way about France. The swift rivers, the fertile valleys, the large cities-its scenery is beautiful. Will you describe the geography of Japan? __eou__ Well, it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands. France isn't an island, is it? __eou__ Oh, no, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent. But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts. Does Japan have good harbors? __eou__ Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, is it? __eou__ No, France isn't very mountainous. But it does contain the Pyrenees, a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons. What kind of Climate does Japan have? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, we don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, doesn't it? __eou__ Yes, the climate of France rarely has severe winters. In southern France, one can live in comfort the whole year. Is Japan good for farming? __eou__ Yes, Japan is good for farming. Rice is the main crop, but Japan is also an industrial center. Fishing is very important, too. Rice isn't grown in France, is it? __eou__ No, rice isn't grown in France. But farming, fishing and industry are also very important in France. I'd like to go to Japan some day. Would you like to visit France? __eou__ Yes. I'd like to visit France. I'd like to travel all over the world. As you describe it, France seems to be very much like Japan. I would like to see it for myself. __eou__
I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice. I smell some rat in it. __eou__ He is sly. He is actually angling for compliments. But he may have got the crush on you. __eou__ Nonsense! There's no indication that he's in love with me. __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed. He may pop the question one of these days. __eou__
Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. __eou__ How come? __eou__ It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't. __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy? __eou__ Yeah. It's so nice of you to comfort me. __eou__
Maybe we'd better go now. __eou__ It's still early. __eou__ Gosh, it's already 10.Stay here if you like. __eou__ Since we're late, let's go to see a film. __eou__ OK.Hurry up. __eou__
My uncle passed away last night. __eou__ My condolences. __eou__
Diana, in your opinion, which is more important, IQ or EQ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question, Jerry? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night. And the question just lined in my mind. __eou__ Well. I think IQ matters more. But it won't work without EQ. __eou__ Why? You seem pretty sure about it. __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life. __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it. __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly. __eou__ That's true, but what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them. __eou__ Yes, Jerry, can you share your understanding of EQ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives. __eou__ Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success? __eou__ Just as Forrest? __eou__ Yes, his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ. __eou__ I got it. __eou__
Come on! It's time to go! __eou__ Wait a minute! Just hold your horses! What's your hurry, anyway? __eou__ Well, I've got to stop and get gas in the car, first. __eou__ That won't take long. __eou__ Well, it won't if there no line at the pump. __eou__ Well, I'm not quite ready. __eou__ I'll give you five more minutes, then I'm going on without you! __eou__ You wouldn't do a thing like that! __eou__ Oh, yes, I would! __eou__
How's business? __eou__ So so. __eou__
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I'm picking the film, because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick. __eou__ Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything. __eou__ Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous. and it's so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back. __eou__ I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative. __eou__ I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage. __eou__ You see, that's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings. __eou__ Well he's more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories. __eou__ Love stories? More like one-night-stands. __eou__ Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours ; they're no saints. __eou__ My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends? __eou__ You're unbearable ; you can walk home, I'm leaving. __eou__
Which language do you speak? __eou__ Well, I studied French at school, but I'Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents? __eou__ Yes, I do. I'm learning Chinese now on the internet. __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet? __eou__ It's not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn't too good. __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write! __eou__ Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they're easy for me. __eou__ So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right? __eou__ Yes. How are the Spanish classes going? __eou__ In a way, it's similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself. __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? __eou__ Sorry, I thought you knew. __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her. __eou__ Didn't I? __eou__ You know you didn't. __eou__ Well, I am telling you now. __eou__ Yes, but you might have told me before. __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested. __eou__ You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her? __eou__ Sorry, I didn't think it mattered. __eou__ Oh, you men! You are all the same. __eou__
So, did you go out with Richard? __eou__ Yeah. We went to a movie last Saturday. We saw Police Partners II. __eou__ Did you like it? __eou__ Richard did, but I didn't. Of course, I told him I liked it. __eou__ Yeah. So did you do anything else? __eou__ Well, we went to a dance club. __eou__ Did you have fun there? __eou__ Yeah, we had a great time. And we're going to go there again next week! __eou__
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation? __eou__ I think I will continue my studies. Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree. We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market. __eou__ So you will continue to study for a master's degree? __eou__ Well, I think so. But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree. If can get a Ph. D. abroad, it will be much easy for me to get a job at home. __eou__ How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad. __eou__ I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad. Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams. If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough, I may get a scholarship. __eou__ It could be pretty tough studying abroad. Being so far away from home... __eou__
It's hard to get tickets for the movie. __eou__ Did you get any? __eou__ Yeah, two at the tenth rows. __eou__ How much is the ticket? __eou__ 3.5 dollars each. __eou__
What a great weekend that was! __eou__ My feeling's exactly. __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer. __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more. __eou__ We should come here more often. __eou__ You are absolutely right. __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend. __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun. __eou__ Yeah, I think so. Oh, by the way, I need to ask you something. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed? __eou__ Sure. Oh, that reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots? __eou__ My boots? Er... Sure, ok. __eou__
Hi, Mr. Smith. Are you enjoying the cookout? You don't look too happy. __eou__ I spent the morning at the cemetery. I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies. __eou__ Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day? __eou__ They should. This holiday is about remembering our war dead. But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts! __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for telling me a little more about it. __eou__
I went to Super Junior's concert last night. It was fantastic. __eou__ Really? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now. I am also a big fan of theirs. __eou__ Yes, their new album just came out last week. It is number one on the billboard. __eou__ I really love their dancing. They are all excellent dancers. __eou__ The lyrics of the new song are beautiful, too. Can you sing? __eou__ Sure. I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now. __eou__ Let's go buy their new album. Want to come with me? __eou__ Why not? __eou__
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. __eou__ If you would like me to, I could help you with that. __eou__ Wouldn't that take you away from your project? __eou__ I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me. __eou__ Is there a good time for you to help me? __eou__ If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready by Friday. __eou__ How about meeting in my office? __eou__ That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have. __eou__ Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot. __eou__ Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise! __eou__
If you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese? __eou__ Why? Did tom pop the question? __eou__ Not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parents'consent. __eou__ Let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right? __eou__ You are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex. __eou__ Oh, how did you deal with it? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up. __eou__ Oh, it's a pity. What was the matter? __eou__ Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family. __eou__ Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first. __eou__ Yes, he said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working. __eou__ So that's why it's hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner. __eou__ Not really. There are many successful mixed marriage around us. __eou__
Where is Tom? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep. __eou__ What? It's only 9p. m. Now. Why today he went to bed so early? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat. __eou__ Oh, I see. __eou__
Hi, Ann. __eou__ Hi. You look excited. What's happening? __eou__ I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days. __eou__ And you're planning to enter? __eou__ Of course. This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice. __eou__ Is there a prize? __eou__ I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio. __eou__ Do you think you have a chance? __eou__ A chance? Not just a chance, I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful. __eou__ But you haven't practised all that much. __eou__ I still have 5 days to practise. It's in the bag! __eou__ Don't be too sure. You're still going to need some help. __eou__ Yeah, maybe. __eou__
I've got to go to bed. Have to work tomorrow. __eou__ OK. Good night, then. Have a good sleep. __eou__ Good night. See you tomorrow. __eou__
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments. They are working very hard these days. Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little. __eou__ That is a good idea, I love it. What time do you think is convenient? __eou__ Well, what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting? __eou__ Ok, I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch. It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time. I am sure they don't want to miss it. __eou__ I hope so. Let me know how many will come. Then I will book the restaurant. __eou__
What day is today? __eou__ Today is Thursday. __eou__ What's the date today? __eou__ Today is May first, 2003. __eou__ Oh, today's International Labour Day. Is it our working day? __eou__ Well, I don't think so. __eou__
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday? __eou__ That would be fine. Where are you going? __eou__ We plan to go to a forest in the suburb. There is a beautiful river there. We can do some fishing. __eou__ Great. __eou__ And don't forget your fishing tackle. __eou__ Ok. I like fishing very much. __eou__
Daniel, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school now? __eou__ The same question to you. __eou__ Well, we shall make it a secret between us. __eou__ Deal, Where is Gucci? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader. They are required to put on a performance. Look! Here they come. __eou__ Oh, look at her. She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA. __eou__ I want to be like her. __eou__ Get real. Don't be so pathetic. __eou__ Hey, young man! I'm your sis. Don't talk to me like that. __eou__ Oh, man, look at her, go! She is amazing! She should be my sis. __eou__ Boy, you've got such a crush on her, haven't you? __eou__ Yes, I want to be her boyfriend. Just like in the movie. __eou__ Are you out of your mind? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut. She thought it was cool. __eou__ Go ahead, have a try and be a joke. __eou__
You know John? __eou__ Which John? Mr.Turnbow's son? __eou__ Yes. I'Ve read news about him in today's paper. __eou__ And he's bright and intelligent. I'm sure he can pass the university entrance exam. __eou__ I wish he could too. __eou__ How's your boy, Jack? __eou__ He's a bit tired, you know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up. __eou__ Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, don't they? __eou__ Good luck to them. __eou__
You have made a poor meal. Let me get you some more fish. __eou__ No, thanks. I have had enough. __eou__ What about some drink? __eou__ Please bring me a cup of coffee. __eou__
Good morning. I want to apply for a library card. __eou__ Give me 10 yuan, your ID card and a photo of you please. __eou__ But I hear that the card is free. __eou__ Yes, it is. But you must pay a deposit for the card. __eou__ There will be a refund when I return the card, right? __eou__ Yes, if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches. __eou__ OK, here you are. __eou__
I am very proud of John. __eou__ Me too. No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business. __eou__ But he has suffered a lot. __eou__
What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here? __eou__ Perhaps they should give it a second thought. The residents are getting up in arms about it. __eou__ I think they will. __eou__
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend? __eou__ To tell you the truth, I don't think much of them. __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher. __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way. __eou__
May I invite you for a dance? __eou__ With pleasure. __eou__ You dance well. Do you breakdance? __eou__ Me, what brought that on? __eou__ There's a story about breakdancing in the paper. __eou__ What does it say? __eou__ According to the story, it's some sort of modern dance style. __eou__ Like disco? __eou__ Well, breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance. __eou__ And disco a kind of nightclub. __eou__ Right, a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music... __eou__ So... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether. __eou__ You are witty. __eou__
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? __eou__ That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place? __eou__ It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. __eou__ Do you need it for the whole weekend? __eou__ We will need it for both days. __eou__ We will need to know who will be driving the van. __eou__ The van will be driven by Mary and me. __eou__ It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that? __eou__ Oh yeah, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom. __eou__ Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening. __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday? __eou__ I don't know. Who? __eou__ Avril Lavigen! __eou__ the Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her? __eou__ yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, her poster, a CD... __eou__ so you're a big fan, eh? __eou__ not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer, too. __eou__ and she was in a movie once again, right? __eou__ yes, though I don't think her acting skills are that great. __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures. __eou__ did you take a photo with her? __eou__ no, there were too many people. When she got out of the car, her fans were all screaming, trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs. __eou__ crazy! __eou__
Can you lend me fifty bucks? __eou__ What? Again? Why do you keep running out of money? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough. __eou__ No, I think it's how you budget your life, that's the problem. __eou__ That's my business, not yours. __eou__ True enough, until the time comes that you need to take my money. I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important. __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day? __eou__ I don't just survive. I put money away as well. I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, and I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises. __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess. __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies. I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits. __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler. I never know where the bus routes actually go. The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line. __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads. Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we'd have fewer traffic jams. __eou__ If we built more roads, people would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars. __eou__ How would you do that? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, they won't use their cars as much. __eou__ I don't know. I think it's unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, for example. __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people's health by discharging all those exhaust fumes. __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular. __eou__ That's a good point. Car owners will probably be against it, but people who use public transport will be in favor of it. __eou__
What day is today? __eou__ Today is December twenty-third, two thousand and two. __eou__ Oh, The day after tomorrow is Christmas. __eou__ Merry Christmas to you. __eou__
You're new here, right? __eou__ Yes, I am. __eou__ Will this be your first year? __eou__ No, I transferred here. __eou__ What school did you come from? __eou__ I transferred from PCC. __eou__ Why'd you transfer here? __eou__ I wanted to attend this school originally, but my grades out of high school weren't good enough. __eou__ Is PCC a good school? __eou__ PCC is great! __eou__ I hope you enjoy it here. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__
The bridegroom looks a bit nervous. __eou__ On this occasion, most people do. __eou__ Oh, they are playing the wedding March. Here they come. __eou__ She is a beautiful bride. __eou__ I am so happy for them. __eou__ Are you crying? __eou__ Yes, I always cry at weddings. __eou__ Harris and Anne are perfect for each other. __eou__ Yes, they are. __eou__ You and Tom also make a great couple. __eou__ In fact, we are beginning to make preparations. __eou__ For the wedding? __eou__ No, no, for the engagement. __eou__ Try to catch this bouquet then. __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week. I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift, but I still have no clue. __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with? __eou__ yeah, that's her. We had a lot of wonderful times together. She is really a special friend, and I want to get her something meaningful. __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier? __eou__ I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last. __eou__ yeah, that's nice. __eou__ hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home. __eou__ a plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs? __eou__ I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border. __eou__ I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer. You don't want to get her in trouble. __eou__
Have you got your invitation yet? __eou__ My invitation? No, I haven't. My invitation to what? __eou__ The house warming party. __eou__ Whose house warming party is it? __eou__ Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house. __eou__ Oh, they have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately. __eou__ It's out in the suburbs. __eou__ Have you seen the house? __eou__ Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend. __eou__ Is it nice? __eou__ Yes, it is. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen. There's also a garden. __eou__ Well, that does sound nice. Have they moved in yet? __eou__ They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight. __eou__ When are they going to have the party? __eou__ Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow. __eou__ Wow, that would be something to look forward to. __eou__
Have you ever been to Xi'an? __eou__ Yes, I'Ve been there several times on business trips. But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city. __eou__ I'Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won't miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place. __eou__ I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening. __eou__ Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane? __eou__ Well, the airport is quite far from the downtown area, but it is still more convenient than taking the train. __eou__
Tomorrow is Sunday. Let's go out and get some fresh air. __eou__ I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei. Are you interested in going there? __eou__ why not? I love animals and I love nature. __eou__ You can see many cows and horses there. lf you are brave enough, you can try horseback riding. it is fun. __eou__ sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there. __eou__ Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here. __eou__ That is true. Some people go camping, some people pick fresh fruit, some people go boating and some people go grass skiing. __eou__ I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm. __eou__ Well, now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try. __eou__ I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first. __eou__ Yes. we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first? __eou__ Of course. I will. __eou__ Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun. __eou__ It is. However, you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider. __eou__ No problem. It is always worth trying something new once in your life time. __eou__
how are you doing? __eou__ I'm ok. I wish I could say the same for my friend. __eou__ what happened to him? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving. __eou__ was it his first offence? __eou__ unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university. __eou__ what happened to him then? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500. __eou__ did they take his license away? __eou__ no, they were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now. __eou__ what do you think will happen to him? __eou__ well, he'll definitely lose his license, pay a fine, and maybe even spend some time in jail. __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer? __eou__ not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, then the state will appoint him with one. __eou__ my sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him. __eou__ that'd be great! I know he'd appreciate your help. __eou__
Well, sir, we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant. __eou__ Is that so? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie? __eou__ I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie. __eou__ Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment? __eou__ Certainly.What time will you come back? __eou__ At seven, please. __eou__ How many in your party? __eou__ A party of three. __eou__ All right.We are waiting for you at seven. __eou__
You know Ernie, it seems we both like the same artists. __eou__ Yes, we do. I think we have the same musical tastes. __eou__ But if we're going to start a band, we have to be able to sing and dance. Can you do that? __eou__ I'm not a very good singer, but I'm a really great dancer! I love hip hop dancing. __eou__ Great! I'll sing, and you can dance in our band. __eou__
I wish I had access to the public library. __eou__ it's easy! Just go and get a card. __eou__
Are you ready? __eou__ Not yet. __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law? __eou__ Yes, he married my sister ten years ago. __eou__ From his looks, I'd say he's a man of character. __eou__ Yes, my sister loves his personality. __eou__
You seem to very busy these days. What are you doing? __eou__ I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday. __eou__ Where did you spend your holiday? __eou__ I went to Paris. __eou__
Our team just scored a goal. __eou__ That's more like it. __eou__ Tell me about it. __eou__ They might actually win the game. __eou__
Want to meet for lunch this Saturday? __eou__ Sorry, I can't. I'm busy. __eou__ What are you doing? __eou__ I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month. __eou__ What kind of volunteer work? __eou__ I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities. __eou__ Oh, yeah? __eou__ Yeah. It's exciting. This month we're doing crossword puzzles. __eou__
Tom, is Jenny crying? __eou__ Can you take he away from me? __eou__ I'm just coming for that. __eou__ She kept on bothering me. __eou__ She's your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can't you be good to her? __eou__ But I am her brother, not her servant. __eou__
You're making my blood boil. __eou__ Calm down. Madam. __eou__ I'm about to explode! You'Ve made a mess of this matter. __eou__ I am very sorry to hear that you'Ve been having so many problems. __eou__ Sorry isn't good enough! What can you do to help me? __eou__ I understand why you're angry, Mrs. Wilson, and believe me, we are doing everything in our power to work this out. __eou__ Well, obviously, what you're doing is not good enough! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days, we should be able to get this straightened out. __eou__
Can you tell me something about financial aid? __eou__ What exactly? __eou__ How to apply for it? __eou__ In your first letter, that is, when you apply for admission, you should also tell them you need their financial aid. __eou__ Then... __eou__ If the aid is available, they will give you two or more application forms, One is for admission, the others are for the aid. __eou__ What if not? __eou__ They will tell you the aid is impossible. __eou__
How was Mei's party on Saturday? __eou__ Oh I didn't go. I stayed at home with my family. __eou__ Oh really? What did you do? __eou__ We watched lots of television and films. __eou__ I see. Anything else? __eou__ Yes, we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine. __eou__ Well, it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself. __eou__
What's the temperature today? __eou__ It's about 5 degrees centigrade. __eou__ What's the weather forecast for tomorrow? __eou__ The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow. __eou__ Are you used to the climate here? __eou__ I think I'll soon get used to it. __eou__ What is the average temperature of Beijing? __eou__ lt's about 180C, but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero. And we have a long winter. __eou__ Which season do you like best? __eou__ I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice. __eou__
I simply couldn't help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that. __eou__ But Ben is not a bad man. I know him from A to Z. __eou__ However, he disappointed us very much this time. __eou__ I can understand that. But... __eou__
Kelly, the guys and I think you should run for senior class president. __eou__ Me? Why me? Why not you? __eou__ We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about. __eou__ And you think I fit the qualifications? __eou__ Yes. Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life? The job doesn't stop when we graduate. __eou__ Really? What is there to do after we graduate? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president. __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified. But I would really have to think about this first. __eou__
Wow! You look like a drowned rat! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today? __eou__ I knew there would be a shower, but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today. __eou__ Well. You'd better take a hot shower right now, or you will catch a cold. __eou__ I know. I don't want to get sick, especially during finals week. __eou__
Why are those people crying? __eou__ They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day. __eou__ Tomb Sweeping Day? What is it? __eou__ Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China, on which many Chinese mourn the dead. __eou__ What do they do? __eou__ People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead. __eou__
Er... Alison? __eou__ Ohm, hello, Marcia. I was... __eou__ I just wanted to congratulate you! I mean, it was a good race and you deserve to win. __eou__ Well... thanks, Marcia.It's very nice of you to say so. I mean... __eou__ It was that final sprint! You were great! Really! __eou__ Do you really think so? I mean, was I? Er... you... must be disappointed. __eou__
Why aren't you at work? __eou__ I called in sick. __eou__
How is the college search going? __eou__ It's a huge headache. I have no idea what I want to do. __eou__ But don't you want to study music? Shouldn't it be easy? __eou__ It should be, but there are too many options. My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices, but after that... __eou__ I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, a big school or a small school, a public or private school... __eou__ Yup, you understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low. __eou__ I see. Well, don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information, and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended. __eou__ Thanks for the information. And good luck in your college search. __eou__
I'm trying to decide what school to apply for. __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? __eou__ I'm not sure. What's the difference between them? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere. __eou__ Which is better? __eou__ One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers. __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools. __eou__ Yeah, sometimes. __eou__
Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class. __eou__ Is this something that you could schedule for another time? __eou__ No, I have to do this ; it's important! __eou__ Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you? __eou__ I've made arrangements with a friend to help me. __eou__ You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you? __eou__ Yes, I know. __eou__ Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me. __eou__ OK, I can do that. __eou__ Well, have a good day off from class. __eou__
It seems so strange to be here, burying you, but it's not you. __eou__ Ashes to ashes and dust to dust... __eou__ This has been the worst and best day of my life, Taylor. They kept you in the hospital, and... __eou__ I'll tell you all about it another day. __eou__ But you're OK? It was nothing serious, was it? __eou__ You ladies look very elegant in black. But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come... __eou__
The air quality in this city is horrendous. The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again! __eou__ Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment. __eou__ On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city. __eou__ As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health. __eou__ I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse effect. __eou__ What is the greenhouse effect exactly? __eou__ It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. __eou__ I see, so it's similar to global warming? __eou__ They're related to one another, yes. __eou__ I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live. __eou__ People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well. __eou__ People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations. __eou__ I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place. __eou__
What would you like to do tonight? __eou__ I'm not sure. __eou__ What about going to a movie? __eou__ OK, let's go to the cinema to see what's on. __eou__
Mary, be calm. __eou__ It is impossible. You cheated on me. __eou__ No, listen to me. I always regard you as my best friend. I admire you, and of course you've helped me so much. I should thank you. __eou__ Shut up! __eou__ No, listen to me. Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well. Maybe in other people's eyes, I want you to be my girl-friend. but... but... __eou__ But you have had lily already? You should have told me about her, but you didn't. __eou__ OK... OK... Anyway. I will treat you as my best friend. I hope you can do the same. __eou__ Leave me! Go away! __eou__
Would you mind doing something for me? __eou__ I would if I could. __eou__ Would you please explain the meaning of the word? __eou__ Yes, With pleasure. __eou__
Our maths teacher is rather humorous. __eou__ On the contrary, I think he's very serious. __eou__ No, not at all.His examples are really interesting. __eou__ So they're easy to remember. __eou__ Yeah, how about your maths teacher? __eou__ He's an old antique, very serious. __eou__ Bad luck, Anne. __eou__ Hey! How about your history teacher? __eou__ She's another antique. __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that. __eou__
Hey, if you're not busy this weekend, would you like to go see a movie? __eou__ Sounds good. What should we see? __eou__ How about that European movie? __eou__ You mean the one starring John Travolta? __eou__ Yeah, that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding. __eou__ Sounds like an interesting film. Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday. __eou__ Okay, see you then. __eou__
Could you do me a favor? __eou__ What is it? __eou__ Could you possibly give me a lift home? __eou__ All right. __eou__ Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you. __eou__ No problem. I'd be happy to. __eou__ Thanks. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much. __eou__
I have an appointment for half past one. __eou__ What can I help you with? __eou__ Well, I have a problem with my class schedule. __eou__ What is it? __eou__ It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time. __eou__ I can understand the problem with that. __eou__ Is there any way that you can fix my schedule? __eou__ No problem, do you want those classes still? __eou__ Yes, I do. __eou__ Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day. __eou__ Thank you very much. __eou__
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy. __eou__ Are you sure of that? __eou__ I am not certain about that. __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it. __eou__
Did you hear that Mary's marriage is on the rocks? __eou__ So I hear. __eou__ Yesterday I met Mary, and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary. __eou__ After all the crises they have survived together, her husband should do such things. She must feel that she's been stabbed in the back. __eou__
Are there any interesting articles in today's newspapers? __eou__ The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states. Few other stories made the front pages. __eou__ Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections? __eou__ There's an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs. We have a subsidiary company l __eou__ Are the reports favorable? __eou__ Generally, the reporters take positive lines. They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of, but there's nothing worrying in the reports. In the classifieds, one of our competitors is a __eou__ That's interesting. They must be thinking of moving into that market. Are there any interesting editorials? __eou__ Not really. They all seem to focus on the election. There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week. __eou__ I'm not surprised. That article certainly added fuel to the debate. Ok. Thanks. Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me? I'd like to read them. __eou__ Sure. There you are. __eou__
Can you imagine a boat letting in the river? __eou__ That would be terrible. __eou__ Sure thing. I have an experience like that. __eou__ Oh, how were you saved finally? __eou__ I was in such a panic at that time. Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning. __eou__
I am looking for some information about home stay. __eou__ Well, I have been in a host home before. During my first year in the us, I stayed with a family. They are nice. __eou__ How did you pay them? __eou__ Well, that depends. If you stay for a long time. They will offer a discount. __eou__
He followed me all the way home! __eou__ That's about five blocks. And around corners too.So he was definitely following you. __eou__ Yes, he was. I'm not imagining it.Finally, just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious.What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police? __eou__ Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again, then maybe you should call. __eou__ Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything. __eou__ I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is. __eou__ Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time, and if he follows you again, then I think we should go to the police.But for now, just try not to worry. __eou__ Alright. And I won't go to that cafe for awhile. __eou__
What's your favorite book? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind. __eou__ Why do you like it best? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot. __eou__ Well. I like the Thorn Birds best. __eou__ Is it very interesting? __eou__ Sure. I like the writer's language, too. __eou__ If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book. __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me? __eou__ That's a good idea. Let's go! __eou__
May I help you? __eou__ I would like to check out these books. __eou__ May I see your library card, please? __eou__ Yes. Here you go. __eou__ Apparently, you have unpaid late fees. __eou__ I do? __eou__ You owe some money. __eou__ Exactly how much do I owe? __eou__ You owe $ 24.50. __eou__ I won't be able to pay that right now. __eou__ Until you pay it, you can't check out books. __eou__ I will pay it. Don't worry. __eou__
How did you choose courses when you were abroad? __eou__ That's a very good question. Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal. In order to do these wisely and effectively, you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor. __eou__ Wait a minute. There are some new terms for me. I can hardly follow you. __eou__ Ok, I will go into more detail. A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation. You can discuss with him the program selection, changing or adding a program, the requirements for graduation, and other problems related to your study. You will choose some courses, and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation. __eou__ Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there. __eou__ Sure, very difficult. __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice. __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you. __eou__
So it is hard to be a black student on campus? __eou__ Yes, in many ways it is. There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life. __eou__ Stereotypes? Like what? __eou__ Well, like since I'm black, I must like rap music, come from the inner city, or play basketball well. __eou__ I do know you like rap music, but the other two are definitely false. I'Ve seen you play basketball. __eou__ Hey! But that's not the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma. __eou__ You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota? That's not true at all, you're really a smart guy. __eou__ I know that, but some people don't think like that. And I get problems from teachers as well. __eou__ Teachers? I didn't think that they would be racist at all. __eou__ Racist? Not exactly. It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic, as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject. Suddenly I become the representative of the black race, as if we all had the same opinion. __eou__ I see. It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US. __eou__
Could you help me? __eou__ What do you need? __eou__ I can't seem to find my class. __eou__ What building is it in? __eou__ It's in the C building. __eou__ Oh, I know exactly where that is. __eou__ Do you think you can tell me where it is? __eou__ Sure, what room number is it? __eou__ It's room number 261. __eou__ I have a class around there right now. __eou__ Could you show me where it is? __eou__ No problem, come on. __eou__
John, have you ever watched Beijing Opera? __eou__ Yes, I watched once. __eou__ What do you think of it? __eou__ Well, honestly speaking, I went to watch it out of curiosity. I'd say it's really a special art form. __eou__ I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan. __eou__ Really? Good for you. __eou__
Let's play a game! __eou__ OK! How about Scrabble? __eou__ No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is! __eou__ OK! __eou__ Let's see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples! __eou__ Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin! __eou__ Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! OK, my turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is also bald! __eou__ Your future husband! __eou__ Not funny. __eou__
Hi Julie, how are things going? __eou__ Everything is great, Tad. How are you? __eou__ I'm doing really well. __eou__ Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table? __eou__ Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window? __eou__ That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee. __eou__ I thought that he was with Malia. __eou__ Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday. __eou__ I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that! __eou__ Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well. __eou__
You can take this car into consideration. It works well and its price is reasonable. __eou__ I was not born yesterday. __eou__
So, Emily, how was your day? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it. __eou__ It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it. __eou__ To be honest, it was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck! __eou__ Why? What happened? __eou__ Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! __eou__ That's not very fair. What did you do? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired for me for sure. __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty poorly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? __eou__ I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company? __eou__ Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion. __eou__ That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders. __eou__ I try to be sensible about it, but it's not very easy. Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it. __eou__ That's so true. When you have a taste for success, you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way. __eou__
Can you speak English? __eou__ Yes I can. I speak it very well. __eou__ Where did you learn it? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child. __eou__ What else can you speak? __eou__ Well, I know a little Italian. __eou__
Hi, Maggy, Did you hear about David? __eou__ About David, No, I didn't hear anything. __eou__ You know, about David and new boss. __eou__ Sorry, I don't quite follow you. __eou__ Well, I hear David have been fired. __eou__ Oh, that is a shame. He is really hard working. __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship, but there was also a rough spot. __eou__ What do you think his strengths are? __eou__ Well, he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations. __eou__
Which school is your children in? __eou__ She is now in a private school. __eou__ Oh, it costs too much. It's more expensive than the public school. __eou__ It's idea of my husband. He is always banging the drum for better schools. __eou__ But the private school amount to better schools. __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it. __eou__ How much is it for each square meter? How large is the apartment? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters. __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once. __eou__ If sounds so tempting. Why not go applying for a loan from the bank? They charge very low interest, so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years. __eou__
I really like the record you lent me the other day. __eou__ I'm glad you like it. __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long. __eou__ Not at all. __eou__ I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it. __eou__ I'm glad. __eou__ Would you mind my keeping it for another week? __eou__
We'd like to have a look around your house? __eou__ Yes, of course, please follow me. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ This is our courtyard. __eou__ It's so spacious, about 40 square metres, right? __eou__ Yes, about 46 square metres. __eou__ Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Very beautiful and very interesting. But why do you hang them in the tree? __eou__ They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, so they hung them in the tree. Then in winter, they can peel corn ears in their leisure time. __eou__ Very good idea. Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness. __eou__
So, where are you going to spend your winter vacation? __eou__ Oh, I'm going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand. __eou__ You have a girlfriend in Thailand? Interesting. How come I have never heard of that? __eou__ Actually it will be my first time to meet her. __eou__ You mean you haven't seen her before? Then, how could she be your girlfriend? Maybe you don't even know her. __eou__ That's true. But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now. Actually we are on an intimate level. We even plan to be engaged next month. __eou__ Congratulations! It's good to follow your heart. But I just didn't expect to be so fast. __eou__ The Internet is making interaction much faster. People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way. __eou__ Probably you're right. __eou__
Hi! Susan! I haven't seen you for ages! __eou__ I've been really busy. How is everything? __eou__ Oh, fine. Hey, why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up? __eou__ Yeah, why not? I've got a little free time on my hands. Where do you want to eat? __eou__
Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is today! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there! What a perfect day to be at the beach! The kids are going to have so much fun! And we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're playing. __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day! I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather! This looks like the perfect spot! Ok kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp. Here, Mary, help me lay down these beach towels. __eou__ There we go. Can you help me with the umbrella? Perfect. __eou__ Ok kids, here'sa beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel. I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don't stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes. __eou__ And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floatier. __eou__ You're back already? The water was too cold, huh? I'll tell you a secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows. __eou__ What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, put that down right now! It could sting you! __eou__ Ah! Not on me! Ow! __eou__
Hello __eou__ Hi Angela, it's Dan. __eou__ Hi B. How are you? __eou__ Good. __eou__ I called you yesterday. Did you get my message? __eou__ Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off. __eou__ No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, right? __eou__ Oh, is that next week? __eou__ Yes. Did you forget? __eou__ No, of course not. I already bought them a present. __eou__ That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, can you tell her for me. __eou__ Sure. Does she know your friend? __eou__ Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how they know each other. __eou__ Are we all going to drive together? __eou__ Yes. I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get Megan. __eou__
Hey, look at the offer I got in my e-mail. It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy? __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible. You shouldn't believe everything you read, especially on the Internet. __eou__ But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money. __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before? __eou__ Pyramid scheme? What is that? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy, like a pyramid. The person at the top asks the people below him for money, and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him. __eou__ Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him. __eou__ Not exactly. The scam keeps on going, with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom. __eou__ What happens then? __eou__ Nothing. The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them, and they get nothing. They end up losing. That's why it's a scam. __eou__ I see. I guess I should be more careful about what I read, especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is. __eou__
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning. What do you say we take a break and listen to some music, okay? __eou__ Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop, too. Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine. __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play, I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator. __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here. __eou__ Yeah, I've got everything from rock n'roll to the latest new - wave stuff. __eou__ To tell you the truth, I'm strictly into classical music. You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart, do you? __eou__ Sorry, my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960's. Music written before then is just history to me. __eou__ Well, speaking of history, let's get back to the books.We'Ve got an exam tomorrow, remember? __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner? Next Saturday? __eou__ Next Saturday? I'm sorry. I'Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter. __eou__ How about Sunday then? __eou__ Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time? __eou__ Does 6,30 suit you? __eou__ It suits us fine. We'll see you then. __eou__ Thanks, goodbye. __eou__
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains. __eou__ I agree, I think that that would be perfect! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January. __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people. __eou__ Yes, you are right. __eou__ What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot. __eou__ Yes, that would work out better. __eou__ You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone. __eou__ Good idea! We'll have to get right on it. __eou__ Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now! __eou__
How may I help you? __eou__ I need to check these books out. __eou__ Do you have your library card? __eou__ Here it is. __eou__ It appears that you have late fees. __eou__ Really? __eou__ Yes, really. __eou__ How much do I owe? __eou__ You owe $ 24.50 in late fees. __eou__ I don't have that much today. __eou__ I'm sorry, but until you pay it, you won't be able to check out any more books. __eou__ I'll pay it as soon as possible. __eou__
Merry Christmas! __eou__ Huh? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here? __eou__ It is? Oh, that's nice. __eou__ Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited? __eou__ Actually, I'd forgotten about it. __eou__ Forgotten about it? How could you? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish. __eou__ Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. __eou__ It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian. __eou__ I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year? __eou__ Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break. __eou__ Well, would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house? __eou__ Not at all. A party is a party. I'll be happy to come. __eou__
Do you want to go shopping with me? __eou__ That's a good idea.What time is good for you? __eou__ How about Saturday morning? __eou__ Sounds good. __eou__
Welcome, young man. No offence, but I haven't seen you here before. __eou__ Of course, this is my first time here. My Mom has a membership here. Here is the card. __eou__ Okay then. You are the younger customer here ever. __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market. __eou__ It's the marketing's fault, I suppose.What do you want to do? __eou__ Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do? __eou__ That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, you gotta grow up. __eou__ I am still young. And I'm growing every minute. __eou__ Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope. __eou__ I love running. Anything else? __eou__ Please change your clothes first! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes. And I do not have anything else with me. __eou__ Sorry, but no jeans here. __eou__ Oh, that's the only place where jeans are not popular. I'd better just go home. __eou__
I hear that the Students'Union is going to take new members. __eou__ Really? Can I join it? __eou__ Of course you can if you like it. __eou__ How can I join it? __eou__ There will be an information session about the Students'Union this Tuesday. You can apply for it then. __eou__ OK, thank you. __eou__
Is that girl your girlfriend? __eou__ No, it's not. __eou__ She doesn't look like our classmate. __eou__ Don't mistake her as somebody. She's my older sister. __eou__ Really, she's so pretty. __eou__
What do you do in summer? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? __eou__ I don't often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. __eou__ What do you do in winter? __eou__ Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter. __eou__ I think most people do. I like wearing nice, colorful clothes in summer, you know, a nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter. __eou__ Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze! __eou__ Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year? __eou__ Thanks to global warming, it could be hotter than ever! __eou__
Happy new year! __eou__ Thank you. Same to you. __eou__ Have you got any plans? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend's, and you? __eou__ My roommate's having a party. __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management? __eou__ Yes, we do. __eou__ How many nights a week is it? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. __eou__ And how long does the course last? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months. __eou__ When does it start? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th. __eou__ What time is the class? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock. __eou__ How much does it cost? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month. __eou__ Yes, that's all right. I want to enroll in the course. __eou__ Thank you, please fill out this form for us. __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now? __eou__ Yes, please. we need a record of you education and your work experiences. __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem. There are thousands of homeless people on the streets. __eou__ How would you solve the problem? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes. __eou__ It would probably be very expensive. __eou__ I think the government can afford it. Besides, there are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i __eou__ It's not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don't seem to have enough money to educate kids properly. __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education, we will need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters. __eou__ Most voters what everything both ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, but without increasing taxes. __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project. __eou__ Yes. The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly __eou__
Do you keep any pets, such as cats, dogs? __eou__ No, I'm scared of cats. __eou__ Oh, but why? __eou__ I feel they're dirty. __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts? __eou__ Sorry, but I'm not really that interested in those things. __eou__ Well, they are very nice you know. __eou__ Really? __eou__ And not expensive either. __eou__ Oh, I don't care about that. __eou__ Everybody is buying them. __eou__ Are they? __eou__ Yes, they are very fashionable, you see. __eou__ I am afraid I am not interested in fashion. __eou__ I see. __eou__ But thank you very much all the same. __eou__ Sorry I couldn't help you. __eou__
Come in, come in! __eou__ Hi, Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE. __eou__ Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment. __eou__ I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other. __eou__ Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions? __eou__ You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie. __eou__ It's okay. I don't want to go now. We'Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie. I don't want to see a movie without watching the beginning. __eou__
how was school today, Dominic? __eou__ I hate school! __eou__ why? What happened? __eou__ I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today! __eou__ it's just one exam. Can you re-take the exam? __eou__ yes, but it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed! __eou__ why didn't you do a good job? __eou__ I don't know. I sat down in my seat, looked at my paper, and then my mind just went totally blank. __eou__ do you think you studied enough for the exam? __eou__ no... __eou__ what did you do last night? __eou__ I watched TV. __eou__ did you study at all last night for your exam? __eou__ no, not really. __eou__ I am sure if you had studied, you would have done well. When can you re-take your exam? __eou__ tomorrow. __eou__ alright. Get out your books and I'll help you prepare. __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time. __eou__ They have moved to Chicago. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job. __eou__
Did you hear about Joe? She hasn't eaten for days. __eou__ Why? What's eating her? __eou__ Love sick. You know who she's in love with? __eou__ I don't have the slightest idea. __eou__ Someone you're living with. __eou__ What? Not my Dad, I hope!? __eou__ Come on, Mary, it's your brother, Jack. __eou__ No kidding! Jack is such a log! He's never dated a girl. __eou__ The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him. __eou__ And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls. He's putting his heart into his stamp collection. __eou__ Well, if you want to help your friend, you should do something about it. __eou__
Oh, they all went out! Did you make a wish? __eou__ Yes, but I doubt if I get it. I've never got it. __eou__ Better luck this time! __eou__
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth? __eou__ At least, it is better than my boxed lunch at work. I'm so fed up with the bland food. Thank you for having lunch with me! __eou__ Any time. But I don't mind eating boxed lunch. The food sanitation is really good too. __eou__ It's hard to believe that you like it. You are so easy to be satisfied. __eou__ Hey, it's not that bad. The food is nutritious and it's really convenient. I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff. __eou__ Eating is important. You are what you eat. It's not only a daily routine. __eou__ Well, will you just go back to work after lunch? __eou__ No. I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch. __eou__ But you didn't eat anything today. __eou__ Well, the bill is paid by month. That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant. __eou__ All right. I'm going to the McDonald's. __eou__ For what? I thought you didn't like western food. __eou__ No, I never did. It's for my son. He loves it, and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week. __eou__ That's really smart. My son Daniel is the same with your son. I just don't get it, why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food. __eou__ Me, either. But, it's for sure that the children market is a really big one. __eou__ That's for sure. It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children. __eou__
What can I do for you today? __eou__ I need to return a book. __eou__ Can I do anything else for you? __eou__ I want to check these books out. __eou__ Is that all? __eou__ That's all. __eou__ May I see your library card, please? __eou__ It's right here. __eou__ Will that be all for today? __eou__ Yes. That's it. __eou__ These are due back in two weeks. __eou__ All right. Have a good night. __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country? __eou__ Most people like football. More boys like football than girls. A few girls play it really well. Some people like playing basketball. __eou__ Do many people like tennis? __eou__ More and more people like it now. fewer people play table tennis than before. Many people like swimming, because it is fun and keeps you fit. __eou__ In my country, many people enjoy golf, but it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them. __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people. Several people from my university enjoy them, but most of us just watch. No one I know plays golf. __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly. There are plenty of golf courses around the country. In the past, only a tiny number of people played. __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country. __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too. __eou__
Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player. __eou__ Oh, you're welcome. __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven. What's put you on? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other. __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick? __eou__ No, I encourage her to go her own way, but she's now having a change of heart. __eou__
I've come to say goodbye. __eou__ When do you leave? __eou__ I'm catching the eleven o'clock train. __eou__ Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch. __eou__ Goodbye. Hope to see you again next year. __eou__
The weather is terrible. __eou__ Yes. It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now. __eou__ I'm wearing my heavy jacket. __eou__ I'm going to put on more clothes, too. __eou__ Will it snow today? __eou__ I don't know. Do you like snowing? __eou__ Yes, when it snows, every where is white. It's very beautiful. __eou__ You can read the newspaper. Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not. __eou__ Good idea. __eou__
This city is far too polluted. We should do something about it. __eou__ I agree. We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often. __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country. __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry. __eou__ No, I've not heard of it. Tell me about it. __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land. Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach. __eou__ Is it just a bus? __eou__ Oh. no.

My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon. Can you tell me something about it? __eou__ Certainly. It's actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year. __eou__ What happens on the holiday? __eou__ Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate. Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year. __eou__ Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday? __eou__ Yes, just like Christmas in western countries, it is a time for eating lots of special food. __eou__
Rachel has decided to quit smoking. __eou__ Really? Why? __eou__ You never guess she is going to have a baby. __eou__ Oh, it's unbelievable. She is such a chain smoker. __eou__ Yes, yes. She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby. __eou__ Oh, she is going to be a great mother. __eou__
Do you know who's just got married? Old McDonald. __eou__ Never! He's over 80, isn't he? __eou__ He's nearly 90. __eou__ Good gracious! Are you sure? __eou__ I am. What's more, his wife is 84. __eou__ Is she really? __eou__ Yes, she is. And guess what, he is her sixth husband. __eou__ Really? Quite a woman, isn't she? __eou__
It's almost midnight! We are about to start a brand new year! __eou__ I know it's so exciting! A new year is always like a clean slate. Fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals. __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution? __eou__ I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution. Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice. __eou__ Yeah I know what you mean. That's why this year I am keeping things more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time, or doing some volunteering work. __eou__ That seems reasonable. We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square. __eou__ Sure, as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight! __eou__ Well, we can't break tradition! It's bad luck! __eou__

I'm really tired of my job in the bank. I'm thinking about changing it. __eou__ Have you any definite idea? __eou__ Not yet, what's your opinion? __eou__ I think you'd better try an active job. __eou__
Mike! What's going on, man! Long time no see! __eou__ Hey, Pat! Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages! How is going? __eou__ Things doing great! It's funny running into you like this. Smell well, just last week I ran into Matt as well. __eou__ Yeah? How's he doing? __eou__ He's doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened. __eou__ Oh yeah? __eou__ Well, we were talking and catching up on what we'Ve been doing, talking about work and family, when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out, and screaming... __eou__ Ha ha, really? __eou__ Yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was staring and laughing... it was hilarious! __eou__
Hey, Jack, where's your car? __eou__ I got rid of that clunker. This is my new one. __eou__ Is that right? It sure beats the old one? __eou__ Jump in, I'll give you a ride. __eou__ Ok. Boy, this looks expensive. __eou__ Yeah, it costed a bundle alright. __eou__ Wow, this's sinking a hole. __eou__ Yeah, this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned. __eou__ I believe it. Hoo, this car corners like it's on rails. __eou__ We are on the high way. I'm the * *. __eou__ Wow, this car can really burn rubber. __eou__ It's a great feeling. __eou__ You made a perfect choice, Jack. __eou__ Thanks, Daisy. __eou__

You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP code. __eou__ Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com. __eou__
I'm here for my appointment. __eou__ What can I do for you today? __eou__ I have an issue with my schedule. __eou__ Tell me the problem. __eou__ I have two classes on here that are at the same time. __eou__ Oh, I see. __eou__ Can you change that for me? __eou__ Do you still want both classes? __eou__ Yes, I would like to keep both classes. __eou__ I'll try to change one to a different day. __eou__ I would greatly appreciate that. __eou__
I'd love to have my own farm. __eou__ It would be very hard work. Are you sure? __eou__ I wouldn't mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy. __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job. __eou__ That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office. __eou__ You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into. __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him. I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields. __eou__ Well, I'd certainly come and visit you. It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm. I'd love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while. __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? __eou__ no idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights. What else is there to see? __eou__ what about a factory tour? __eou__ you mean visit a factory? __eou__ yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry. __eou__ good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? __eou__ I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour. __eou__ really? What do the companies do that for? __eou__ I believe most of them think of it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known. __eou__ oh, i see. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors. __eou__ exactly. __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check. __eou__
Look, here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao  the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty. These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty. __eou__ How can you tell the difference? From what I see, they look almost the same. __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it, while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period. Look carefully, and tell me if you see the difference now. __eou__ Yes, they are different! But it's too professional. What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake. Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins. We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines. We can judge it with naked eyes. __eou__ I see. By the way, China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history. Did they issue their own coins in China? __eou__ Certainly, they did. Liao Coins and Song Coins, for example, coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago. The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style, just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe. Let me look for one and show you. __eou__ If you happen to find one, please bargain with the owner for it. I'd like to have one. It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal. __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow. __eou__ It's the fourth one this year. Isn't it horrible. __eou__ Yes. We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading. __eou__ It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees. __eou__ But we need the wood. __eou__ But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood. __eou__
What are you guys doing? __eou__ Just having a chat. __eou__
What's wrong with you, Mr. Polly? __eou__ What's wrong? I want a break from this horrible job. __eou__ Then, buy a bottle of soft drink. __eou__ Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop? __eou__ It's a problem, because my boss is in that shop now. __eou__ Ok, I will go there myself. __eou__ Sorry, Mr. Polly. __eou__ It doesn't matter. Oh, God, I have only four dollars in my wallet. Is that possible for me to buy one? __eou__ Have a try. __eou__
I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight. __eou__ How about coming with me to meet my American friends? __eou__ Hey, that sounds great. __eou__ Okay, I'll pick you up at eight o'clock. __eou__
What's the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning? __eou__ I look at myself in the mirror. Sometimes, it's not a pleasant sight, especially if I have been out late the late before. __eou__ Do you usually shower or take a bath? __eou__ I usually don't have time for a bath in the mornings, so I just take a shower. Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one, especially if it's winter and I need to warm up. __eou__ Do you shave every morning? __eou__ I shave every workday, but I only shave at weekends if I'm going out somewhere. If I'm staying at home, I don't shave. __eou__ Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend? __eou__ Yes. I brush my teeth in the morning, just before I go to work. It's actually the last thing I do before leaving. Then I brush again before bed. __eou__ Your dentist must be proud of you! __eou__
Miss Wang, would you mind my asking you a personal question? __eou__ No, not at all.Go ahead. __eou__ Are you married? __eou__ Yes.Is that so important? __eou__ Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way, do you have any children? __eou__ Yes, I have a three-year-old son. __eou__
I'm not satisfied with it. __eou__ Why not? What's wrong with it? __eou__ Sometimes it goes fast. And sometimes it goes slow. And the alarm doesn'twork, either. __eou__ Would you like another one? __eou__ No. Can I have my money back? __eou__ Hmm... have you got a receipt? __eou__ A receipt? __eou__ Yes. I must see your receipt. You can't have your money back without receipt. __eou__ Oh, I'm not certain, but I think I've lost it. __eou__
Morning, Tom. __eou__ Hi, Mary. __eou__ You seem to be in a hurry. __eou__ Yes. I'Ve got a meeting in a minute. __eou__ Okay. I won't hold you up then. __eou__ Right. I'll see you later. __eou__ See you later. __eou__
Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not? __eou__ To be frank, I was married once, and now I'm single. __eou__ Do you mean you got a divorce? __eou__ Yes, my first marriage was a failure. __eou__
Let me clear away the broken glass. __eou__ No, I can manage it myself.Just sit down, please. __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass. __eou__ Never mind. __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately? __eou__ How could I help but follow it? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company! The exchange rates are eating into our profits, and we can't do anything about it. __eou__ It's really frustrating, isn't it? I have the same problem. I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable. With the way the dollar plummeting lately, my securities have gone up in smoke. __eou__ Every day I have less money! I haven't spent anything, it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate. __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro. I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter, I think it's about time to buy in. __eou__ What about the Yen? __eou__ Are you kidding? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar! __eou__
What a lovely day. The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue. It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan. __eou__ Great idea. Unlike you, I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand. I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin. __eou__ Come on. Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries. __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries. __eou__ That is a really interesting fact. __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach. __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing. __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy. Let's put the stuff under the tree. __eou__ Good idea. It is always cooler in a shade. __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water. My feet are burning when I stand on the sand. __eou__
What time is it, Tom? __eou__ Just a minute. It's ten to nine by my watch. __eou__ Is it? I have no idea if I'm so late. I must be off now. __eou__ What's the hurry? __eou__ I must catch the nine-thirty Train. __eou__ It's plenty of time yet. The railway station is very close. It won't take your twenty minutes to get there. __eou__
Did you bring some lunch with you? __eou__ Yes, I packed it myself. __eou__ Wow, that looks beautiful. __eou__ It's my health-conscious lunch, good for my health and beauty. __eou__ I might try it myself. __eou__
Can you name some festivals of religious nature? __eou__ Yes, such as Christmas and Easter. __eou__ What about historic festivals? __eou__ Thanksgiving Day, Independence Day. __eou__
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are. __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up? __eou__ I'm not surprised. She's a plain Jane. __eou__ And he's so handsome. __eou__
Where's Bob? __eou__ It seems like he's not coming. __eou__ Can you give him a call on his mobile? __eou__ Sure. __eou__
excuse me ; is this seat taken? __eou__ no. It's all yours. __eou__ thank you very much. My name is Ashlan. It's nice to meet you. __eou__ Carson. It's nice to mee you, too. __eou__ the weather is so warm for December, don't you think? __eou__ it is unusually warm. I blame it on global warming. __eou__ global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere. __eou__ so sure. Are you from around here? __eou__ no. I'm new here. I just moved here a few months ago. __eou__ where are you from? __eou__ I'm from China. What about you? __eou__ I am from Texas. I was in China once, but it was a long time ago. __eou__ did you enjoy it? __eou__ I did. I especially liked the food. What do you think about the food here? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food, but I am getting used to it. __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there? __eou__ yes, have you read it? __eou__ no, but I saw the movie. What do you think about it? __eou__ well, to be honest, I've only gotten though 10 pages of it. So far, though, it's interesting. __eou__ well, this is my stop. it was nice talking with you. __eou__ likewise. Bye! __eou__
Would you like a cup of coffee? __eou__ Yes. That would be good. __eou__ Oh, no. __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ This machine is out of order. __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money? __eou__ I sure did. __eou__ You ought to complain. These machine are always out of order. __eou__
Hello, Mary. Nice day, isn't it? __eou__ Yes, what a wonderful day! The sky has cleared up in the end. __eou__ I do feel like an outdoor exercise. After all, we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time. __eou__ How about taking a walk in the park? __eou__ OK. It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh. __eou__ ( After they entering the park ) Great, it's so quiet here. We have the park to ourselves, only you and me. __eou__ Are you kidding? Don't you see many people over there? Just on your right. __eou__ Oh, I see them. Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people. __eou__ Ah, you changed so fast. __eou__
How was the party last night? Did you enjoy it? __eou__ Oh, don't talk to me about last night! It was the most awful evening I'Ve ever had. __eou__ Why? What happened? __eou__ Well. Mary had promised to be my date, but she stood me up. I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind. __eou__ What about the party? __eou__ It was boring. The music was too slow and the food was lousy and, above all, I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time. __eou__ So how long did you stay? __eou__ I left after the opening dance. I couldn't wait to get out of there. __eou__
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff? __eou__ Let me see. Laptop, flash disk, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a notebook, a pair of glasses, cell phone, charger, moisture, notion,... Oh, that is too much. You are not going to a business trip. __eou__ I guess I need all of them. __eou__ Actually, the company will provide you with all of these supplies. So, you can leave this very thick notebook at home. __eou__ I know. But it is my lucky charm. I carry it all the time. __eou__ Suit yourself. Don't forget to set the alarm clock. __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year? __eou__ Because they are full-grown. Look at their curvy figures. __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way. __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys. __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly. Are you aware that previous'small potato'Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl. __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me. I know those sexy women are your tastes. __eou__ You are so Platonic. Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women. They can't resist love, and men cannot resist their attraction either. __eou__ I appreciate the saying'Love consists in this, that two solitude protect, border and salute each other.'__eou__
This one looks great! I love the seashore. __eou__ So do I. The sun... the sand... the ocean! __eou__ And listen to this! What do you think of sailing, swimming, windsurfing, and fishing? __eou__ Oh, Tom! They sound fantastic. I really like all those things. __eou__ Yeah... me, too. __eou__ Well, except fishing. To be honest, I hate fishing, but I love all the others. __eou__ Hey! Look at this! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach. __eou__ You know. I really don't those big hotels. __eou__ Neither do I. Let's stay in a cabin.It'll be much nicer right beside the ocean. __eou__
May, look, what's that in the cage? __eou__ Don't you know that? It's panda. __eou__ Of course I know. I just can't see it very well. __eou__ OK, then put on your glasses, and do you know what does the panda eat? __eou__ Of course, Bamboo! __eou__ That's right. __eou__ I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship. __eou__ You sound quite knowledgeable. __eou__ Not really, panda is my favorite animal. __eou__ Actually, it likes milk too. __eou__ Any way, in a word, panda is our friend. __eou__ Do you know other famous animals in the world? __eou__ Yeah, let me think, the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous. __eou__ That's right. OK, let's move on. __eou__

John, did you have a dream when you was a little boy? __eou__ Of course I did. I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up. But unfortunately, I didn't realize it. __eou__ I had the same experience with you. When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist. But now you see, I'm just a common office clerk. __eou__ Okay, forget about that. S, do you have some practical dreams at present? __eou__ I do. And now I'm working hard to learn English, and I want to be an interpreter some day. __eou__ You're promising. Just follow your dream and never give up. __eou__ Thanks, I will. __eou__
Hi Joe. You've met my new assistant, right? __eou__ Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. __eou__ You are kidding, but she's so helpful. __eou__ Tom... you are her boss, you down. Of course, she's helpful to you. __eou__ Come on. She's like that with everyone. __eou__ I don't think so actually. She never even says "hello" to me. __eou__
Eric, how long will you be in China? __eou__ I don't know. Well, my contract here is for one year, and I don't know what I should do after that. Maybe going around for a while. __eou__ Well, have you ever thought about learning some Chinese? __eou__ Actually, I am learning that now. But it's too hard for me. You know the four tones and the stuff. It really freaks me out. __eou__ Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy. __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head. __eou__ Well, are you invested in some language-exchange program? __eou__ What is it? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese, and in exchange you teach me English. __eou__ Awesome. I've been giving this a lot of thought. When can we do this? __eou__ How about this sunday? __eou__ Ok, cool. __eou__ Good. I'll give you a call tonight. __eou__ No problem.
